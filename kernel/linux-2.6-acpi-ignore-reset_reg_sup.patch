Subject: ACPI: Ingore the RESET_REG_SUP bit when using ACPI reset mechanism
X-Git-Tag: v2.6.28-rc1~26^2~22^2
X-Git-Url: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=8fd145917fb62368a9b80db59562c20576238f5a

ACPI: Ingore the RESET_REG_SUP bit when using ACPI reset mechanism

According to ACPI 3.0, FADT.flags.RESET_REG_SUP indicates
whether the ACPI reboot mechanism is supported.

However, some boxes have this bit clear, have a valid
ACPI_RESET_REG & RESET_VALUE, and ACPI reboot is the only
mechanism that works for them after S3.

This suggests that other operating systems may not be checking
the RESET_REG_SUP bit, and are using other means to decide
whether to use the ACPI reboot mechanism or not.

Here we stop checking RESET_REG_SUP.
Instead, When acpi reboot is requested,
only the reset_register is checked. If the following
conditions are met, it indicates that the reset register is supported.
	a. reset_register is not zero
	b. the access width is eight
	c. the bit_offset is zero
