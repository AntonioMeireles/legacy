    ath5k: always extend rx timestamp with tsf
    
    always extend the rx timestamp with the local TSF, since this information is
    also needed for proper IBSS merging. this is done in the tasklet for now, maybe
    has to be moved to the interrupt handler like in madwifi.

    ath5k: configure backoff for IBSS beacon queue
    
    in "11.1.2.2 Beacon generation in an IBSS" the IEEE802.11 standard says, each
    STA should... "b) Calculate a random delay uniformly distributed in the range
    between zero and twice aCWmin × aSlotTime,".
    
    configure cwmin and cwmax of the beacon queue in IBSS mode according to this.
    unfortunately beacon backoff does not work reliably yet, so i suspect we have a
    problem somewhere else, since the same settings (and similar beacon timer
    configuration) work for madwifi.

    ath5k: use SWBA to detect IBSS HW merges
    
    use SWBA (software beacon alert) interrupts to keep track of the next beacon
    time und check if a HW merge (automatic TSF update) has happened on every
    received beacon with the same BSSID.
    
    this is necessary because the atheros hardware will silently update the local
    TSF in IBSS mode, but not its beacon timers. if the TSF is ahead of the beacon
    timers no beacons are sent until the timers wrap around (typically after about
    1 minute).
    
    this solution is not very nice, since we have to look into every beacon, but
    there is apparently no other way to detect HW merges.

    ath5k: better beacon timer calculation
    
    update ath5k_beacon_update_timers() for better beacon timer calculation in a
    variety of situations. most important is the possibility to call it with the
    timestamp of a received beacon, when we detected that a HW merge has happened
    and we need to reconfigure the beacon timers based on that.
    
    we call this from the mac80211 callback reset_tsf now instead of beacon_update,
    and there will be more use of it in the next patch.

    b43: Fix MAC control and microcode init
    
    This zeros out all microcode related memory before loading
    the microcode.
    
    This also fixes initialization of the MAC control register.
    The _only_ place where we overwrite the contents of the MAC control
    register is at the beginning of b43_chip_init().
    All other places must do read() -> mask/set -> write() to not
    overwrite existing bits.
    
    This also adds a longer delay for waiting for the microcode
    to initialize itself. It seems that the current timeout is sufficient
    on all available devices, but there's no real reason why we shouldn't
    wait for up to one second. Slow embedded devices might exist.
    Better safe than sorry.

    iwlwifi: fix problem when rf_killswitch change during suspend/resume
    
    After we delay device initialization until interface up, there are more
    conditions for the hardware rf_kill switch states during suspend and
    resume. For example, before suspend we can have interface up or down,
    rf_kill enable or disable; before resume we can have rf_kill enable or
    disable. So there are totally 2^3 = 8 conditions to handle. This patch
    addressed this problem and makes sure every condition works correctly.
    
    This patch also merges the device suspend and resume handlers with the
    mac_start and mac_stop code since they are basically doing the same
    thing.

    iwlwifi: delay firmware loading from pci_probe to network interface open
    
    This patch moves the firmware loading (read firmware from disk and load
    it into the device SRAM) from pci_probe time to the first network
    interface open time. There are two reasons for doing this:
    
    1. To support kernel buildin iwlwifi drivers. Because kernel initializes
       network devices subsystem before hard disk and SATA subsystem, it is
       impossible to get the firmware image from hard disk in the PCI probe
       handler. Thus delaying the firmware loading into the network
       interface open time is the way to go. Note, we only read the firmware
       image from hard disk the first time the interface is open. After this
       is succeeded, we cache the firmware image into the host memory. This
       is a performance gain when user open and close the interface multiple
       times and is necessary for device suspend and resume.
    
    2. For better power saving. When the iwlwifi modules are loaded (or
       buildin the kernel) but the wireless network interface is not being
       used, it is a good practice the wireless device consumes as less
       power as possible. Unloading the firmware from the wireless device
       and unregister the driver's interrupt handler in the network
       interface close handler provides users a way to achieve this. User
       space network configuration tools (i.e NetworkManager) can also
       contribute here when it detects a wired cable is connected and
       close the wireless interface automatically.
    
    This patch also includes the pci_save/restore_state() fixed by Ian Schram
    upon the first version.

    rt2500usb and rt73usb data and desc pointer initialization
    was incorrect because it was using uninitialized variables
    to determine the length.
    
    In addition rt2500usb used skb_pull and removed the ieee80211
    from each received frame instead of using skb_trim to remove
    the device descriptor from the frame.
    
    Finally this also fixes the descriptor override when 4 byte
    aligning occured. We still need a completely valid descriptor
    when using the TX/RX dumping capabilities in debugfs.

    mac80211: add unified BSS configuration
    
    This patch (based on Ron Rindjunsky's) creates a framework for
    a unified way to pass BSS configuration to drivers that require
    the information, e.g. for implementing power save mode.
    
    This patch introduces new ieee80211_bss_conf structure that is
    passed to the driver via the new bss_info_changed() callback
    when the BSS configuration changes.
    
    This new BSS configuration infrastructure adds the following
    new features:
     * drivers are notified of their association AID
     * drivers are notified of association status
    
    and replaces the erp_ie_changed() callback. The patch also does

    mac80211: dont use interface indices in drivers
    
    This patch gets rid of the if_id stuff where possible in favour of
    a new per-virtual-interface structure "struct ieee80211_vif". This
    structure is located at the end of the per-interface structure and
    contains a variable length driver-use data area.
    
    This has two advantages:
     * removes the need to look up interfaces by if_id, this is better
       for working with network namespaces and performance
     * allows drivers to store and retrieve per-interface data without
       having to allocate own lists/hash tables

    Add rtl8180 wireless driver
    
    This patch adds a mac80211 based wireless driver for the rtl8180 and
    rtl8185 PCI wireless cards.  Also included are some rtl8187 changes
    required due to the relationship between that driver and this one.
    
    Michael Wu is primarily responsible for the initial driver and rtl8185
    support.  Andreas Merello provided the additional rtl8180 support.
    
    Thanks to Jukka Ruohonen for the donating a rtl8185 card! It was very
    helpful for the rtl8225z2 code.

    rt2x00: Only set the TBCN flag when the interface is configured to send beacons.
    
    These flags used to be fixed to one in rt2500pci_config_type, which
    caused the beacon timer interrupt to fire. This would lead to
    rt2x00lib_beacondone adding work which called
    rt2x00lib_beacondone_scheduled which called ieee80211_beacon_get which
    printed an error about not having any beacon data.
    
    With this patch, these interrupts are only generated when the interface
    is configured to send beacons.

    prism54: remove questionable down_interruptible usage
    
    Reviewing the semaphore usage I noticed these down_interruptible calls.  Most
    of these aren't returning anything, so a caller can't tell if the operation
    completed or not.  prism54_wpa_bss_ie_get() returns zero, but it's treated as
    the function failing which doesn't seem correct.

    This turns out to be true only for rtl8180. On rtl8187, power levels are
    indeed stored in nibbles, so this patch is wrong. Please revert this patch.

    ray_cs fixes
    
    bugs galore:
    	* 0xf380 instead of htons(ETH_P_AARP), etc.  Works only on l-e.
    	* back in 2.3.20 driver got readb() and friends instead of
    direct dereferencing of iomem.  Somebody got too enthusiatic and replaced
    	ntohs(p->mrx_overflow)
    with
    	ntohs(read(&p->mrx_overflow)
    without noticing that (a) the sucker is 16bit and (b) that expression can't possibly
    be portable anyway (hell, on l-e it's always less than 256, on b-e it's always a
    multiple of 256).  Proper fix is
    	swab16(readw(&p->mrx_overflow)
    taking into account the conversion done by readw() itself.  That crap happened
    in several places; the same fix applies.
    	* untranslate() assumes little-endian almost everywhere, except for
    the code checking for IPX/AARP packets; there we forgot ntohs(), so that part
    only works on big-endian.

    rc80211_pid should respect fixed rates.
    
    I would argue that mac80211 should handle fixed rates outside the rate
    control code, which would also allow them to take effect immediately
    instead of during the rate control callback, but this is pretty close
    to correct.

    mac80211: better rate control algorithm selection
    
    This patch changes mac80211's Kconfig/Makefile to:
     * select between the PID and the SIMPLE rate control
       algorithm as default
     * always allow tri-state for the rate control algorithms,
       building those that are selected 'y' into the mac80211
       module (if that is a module, otherwise all into the kernel)
     * force the default rate control algorithm to be built into
       mac80211
    
    It also makes both rate control algorithms proper modules again
    with MODULE_LICENSE etc.
    
    Only if EMBEDDED is the user allowed to select "NONE" as default
    which will cause no algorithm to be selected, this will work
    only when the driver brings one itself (e.g. iwlwifi drivers).

    This patch handles the reordering of the Rx A-MPDU.
    This issue occurs when the sequence of the internal MPDUs is not in the
    right order. such a case can be encountered for example when some MPDUs from
    previous aggregations were recieved, while others failed, so current A-MPDU
    will contain a mix of re-transmited MPDUs and new ones.

    Although this separation has no affect in regular mode of operation, this kind
    of mechanism will be used in A-MPDU frames reordering as it allows accumulation
    of frames during pre-handling, dispatching them to later handling when necessary.

    mac80211: Restore rx.fc before every invocation of ieee80211_invoke_rx_handlers
    
    This patch fixes a problem with rx handling on multiple interfaces. Especially
    when using hardware-scanning and a wireless driver (i.e. iwlwifi) which is
    able to receive data while scanning.
    
    The rx handlers can modify the skb and the frame control field (see
    ieee80211_rx_h_remove_qos_control) but since every interface gets its own
    copy of the skb each should get its own copy of rx.fc too.
    
    In my case the wlan0-interface did not remove the qos-control from the frame
    because the corresponding flag in rx.fc was already removed while processing
    the frame on the master interface. Therefore somehow corrupted frames were
    passed to the userspace.

    libertas: allow for PS mode to be disabled when firmware doesn't support it
    
    Otherwise, we go into an endless busy loop trying to enable PS mode when
    the command queue is empty, dealing with the error response, and then
    trying to enable PS mode again because the command queue is empty.... it
    doesn't really save much power.

    DNLD_RES_RECEIVED is a bit of a misnomer -- we never wait for the result
    to be received; it's purely representing the state of the TX path, and
    in this case the TX path is definitely busy.
    
    Of course, that means that we don't actually care about DATA_SENT vs.
    CMD_SENT either, but that's a can of worms for another day...

    libertas: fix buffer handling of PS_MODE commands and responses
    
    Commit 5b8845345e7385d2eb37fac22ba9ab6905988be5 (or, in case the git
    workflow is broken and patches get recommitted, the commit entitled
    'libertas: rename and re-type bufvirtualaddr to cmdbuf' by dcbw),
    introduced a number of bugs where we once had a pointer to a command
    _payload_, but now we use the pointer to the command header instead.
    
    The fix isn't wonderfully pretty for now, but it'll get better when we
    finish converting all commands so the structures include the header.

    b43legacy: Fix rfkill radio LED
    
    This fixes Bug #9414 for b43legacy. This patch is the equivalent of one
    submitted earlier for b43.
    
    Since addition of the rfkill callback, the LED associated with the off
    switch on the radio has not worked for several reasons:
    
    (1) Essential data in the rfkill structure were missing.
    (2) The rfkill structure was initialized after the LED initialization.
    (3) There was a minor memory leak if the radio LED structure was inited.
    
    Once the above problems were fixed, additional difficulties were noted:
    
    (4) The radio LED was in the wrong state at startup.
    (5) The radio switch had to be manipulated twice for each state change.
    (6) A circular mutex locking situation existed.
    (7) If rfkill-input is built as a module, it is not automatically loaded.
    
    This patch fixes all of the above and removes a couple of sparse warnings.

    This fixes a problem with the radiotap injection code where injecting

    mac80211: allow easier multicast/broadcast buffering in hardware
    
    There are various decisions influencing the decision whether to buffer
    a frame for after the next DTIM beacon. The "do we have stations in PS
    mode" condition cannot be tested by the driver so mac80211 has to do
    that. To ease driver writing for hardware that can buffer frames until
    after the next DTIM beacon, introduce a new txctl flag telling the
    driver to buffer a specific frame.
    
    While at it, restructure and comment the code for multicast buffering
    and remove spurious "inline" directives.

    mac80211: clean up eapol handling in TX path
    
    The previous patch left only one user of the ieee80211_is_eapol()
    function and that user can be eliminated easily by introducing
    a new "frame is EAPOL" flag to handle the frame specially (we
    already have this information) instead of doing the (expensive)
    ieee80211_is_eapol() all the time.
    
    Also, allow unencrypted frames to be sent when they are injected.

    mac80211: clean up eapol frame handling/port control
    
    This cleans up the eapol frame handling and some related code in the
    receive and transmit paths. After this patch
     * EAPOL frames addressed to us or the EAPOL group address are
       always accepted regardless of whether they are encrypted or not
     * other frames from a station are dropped if PAE is enabled and
       the station is not authorized
     * unencrypted frames (except the EAPOL frames above) are dropped if
       drop_unencrypted is enabled
     * some superfluous code that eth_type_trans handles anyway is gone
     * port control is done for transmitted packets

    This adds a new debugfs file from which rate control relevant events can be
    read one event per line. The output includes the current time, so graphs can be
    created showing the rate control parameters. This helps in evaluating and
    tuning rate control parameters. While at it, we split headers and code for

    mac80211: make PID rate control algorithm the default
    
    This makes the new PID TX rate control algorithm the default instead of the
    rc80211_simple rate control algorithm. The simple algorithm was flawed in
    several ways: it wasn't responsive at all and didn't age the information it was
    relying on properly. The PID algorithm allows us to tune characteristics such
    as responsiveness by adjusting parameters and was found to generally behave
    better.
    
    The default algorithm can be overridden to select simple instead. Which
    ever algorithm is the default is included as part of the mac80211
    module automatically. The other algorithm (simple vs. pid) can
    be selected for inclusion as well. If EMBEDDED is selected then
    the choice is available to have no default specified and neither
    algorithm included in mac80211. The default algorithm can be set
    through a modparam.
    
    While at it, mark rc80211-simple as deprecated, and schedule it
    for removal.

    libertas: fix lbs_rtap attribute in sysfs
    
    At least it doesn't oops when you attempt to read or write it now.
    Only when you enable it and then later turn it off. And when it's
    enabled I don't see how it actually works.
    
    But one fewer oops is good, for now...

    libertas: switch lbs_cmd() to take a callback function pointer
    
    All existing code which sends commands is set up to have some function
    called with the results, not to get data back. It's more versatile this
    way, and providing it with a callback function which involves memcpy()
    is hardly difficult.

    Using an arbitrary firmware command was actually very painful. One

    structs to the big union in "struct cmd_ds_command" and add the
    define for the CMD_802_11_xxx to the proper place.
    
    With this function, this is now much easier. For now, it implements
    a blocking (a.k.a. CMD_OPTION_WAITFORRSP) way where one deals directly
    with command requests and response buffers. You can do everything in
    one place:

    Move is_legacy() macro family from iwl-4965-hw.h to iwl-4965-rs.h
    
    These macros are for driver's rate scaling implementation, and are not
    related to hardware or uCode API values (moved from iwl-4965-hw.h).

    Restrict rssi average updating to beacon frames of the bssid the
    interface is
    associated with. Without this restriction, strong signals belonging to other
    BSS, e.g. beacon frames coming from a nearby AP, would cause incorrectly high
    rssi approximation values. This would then cause the link tuner to reduce
    sensitivity, resulting in transmissions from the BSS associated to to be
    missed.

    This adds TX/RX frame dumping capabilities through debugfs.
    The intention is that with this approach debugging of rt2x00 is
    simplified since _all_ frames going in and out of the device
    are send to debugfs as well along with additional information
    like the hardware descriptor.
    
    Based on the patch by Mattias Nissler.
    Mattias also has some tools that will make the dumped frames
    available to wireshark: http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/rt2x00/

    b43: Changes to enable BCM4311 rev 02 with wireless core revision 13
    
    The BCM94311MCG rev 02 chip has an 802.11 core with revision 13 and
    has not been supported until now. The changes include the following:
    
    (1) Add the 802.11 rev 13 device to the ssb_device_id table to load b43.
    (2) Add PHY revision 9 to the supported list.
    (3) Change the 2-bit routing code for address extensions to 0b10 rather
        than the 0b01 used for the 32-bit case.
    (4) Remove some magic numbers in the DMA setup.
    
    The DMA implementation for this chip supports full 64-bit addressing with
    one exception. Whenever the Descriptor Ring Buffer is in high memory, a
    fatal DMA error occurs. This problem was not present in 2.6.24-rc2 due
    to code to "Bias the placement of kernel pages at lower PFNs". When
    commit 44048d70 reverted that code, the DMA error appeared. As a "fix",
    use the GFP_DMA flag when allocating the buffer for 64-bit DMA. At present,
    this problem is thought to arise from a hardware error.
    
    This patch has been tested on my system and by Cédric Caumont
    <icare40@hotmail.com>.

    libertas: rework event subscription
    
    This patch moves re-works the implementation of event subscription
    via debugfs. For this:
    
    * it tells cmd.c and cmdresp.c about CMD_802_11_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT
    * removes lots of low-level cmd stuff from debugfs.c
    * create unified functions to read/write snr, rssi, bcnmiss and
      failcount
    * introduces #define's for subscription event bitmask values
    * add a function to search for a specific element in an IE
      (a.k.a. TLV)
    * add a function to find out the size of the TLV. This is needed
      because lbs_prepare_and_send_command() has an argument for a
      data buffer, but not for it's lengths and TLVs can be, by
      definition, vary in size.

    libertas: separate mesh connectivity from that of the main interface
    
    The transmit and receive traffic as soon as the mesh interface is
    brought up.
    
    Test case 1:  Bring up only the mesh interface and ping.  No need for
    any iwconfig commands on the main interface.
    
    $ ifconfig msh0 192.168.5.3
    $ iwconfig msh0 channel X
    $ ping 192.168.5.2
    If ping succeeds, PASS
    
    Test case 2:  Associate with the main interface, and turn off AP.  Mesh
    interface should not lose connectivity.
    
    $ iwconfig eth0 mode managed essid "my_ssid"
    $ ifconfig msh0 192.168.5.3
    $ ping 192.168.5.2
    <turn off access point>
    If ping continues uninterrupted, PASS
    
    This feature requires firmware version 5.110.19.p0 or newer, available
    here: http://dev.laptop.org/pub/firmware/libertas/

    libertas: reset devices upon disconnect rather than module unloading
    
    1) Do not reset libertas devices upon module unload.  We're unloading
    the module, we're not killing off devices.
    2) Instead, reset libertas devices inside if_usb_disconnect, as we're
    killing off interfaces and so on.
    3) Resetting via disconnect callback means we no longer need to keep
    track of probed libertas devices; kill off that list (and its wonderful
    lack of locking..), as well.
    
    Drop a useless comment as well.

    Shaddy Baddah found an alignment problem with zd1211rw driver at

    Notify that the problem does only affect the old zd1211rw softmac
    driver and not the zd1211rw-mac80211 driver. Daniel Drake has
    already provided a patch for the replacement of the softmac

    ssb: Convert to use of the new SPROM structure
    
    In disagreement with the SPROM specs, revision 3 devices appear to have
    moved the MAC address.
    
    Change ssb to handle the revision 4 SPROM, which is a different size.
    This change in size is handled by adding a new variable to the ssb_sprom
    struct and using it whenever possible. For those routines that do not
    have access to this structure, a 'u16 size' argument is added.
    
    The new PCI_ID for the BCM4328 is also added.
    
    Testing of the Revision 4 SPROM, which is used on the BCM4328, was done
    by Michael Gerdau <mgerdau@tiscali.de>.

    ssb: Add new SPROM structure while keeping the old
    
    The SPROM's for various devices utilizing the Sonics Silicon Backplane come
    with various revisions. The Revision 2 SPROM inherited the data layout of 1, and
    Revision 3 inherited the layout of 2. The first instance of Revision 4 has
    now been found in a BCM4328 wireless LAN card. This device does not inherit any
    layout from previous versions. Although it was possible to create a data
    structure that kept all the old layouts, we decided to start fresh, keep only
    those SPROM variables that are used by the drivers that utilize ssb, and to
    do the conversion in such a manner that neither compilation or execution will
    be affected if a bisection lands in the middle of these changes, while keeping
    the patches as small as possible.
    
    In this patch, the sprom structures are changed while maintaining the old ones.

    rt2x00: Allow rt61 to catch up after a missing tx report
    
    Sometimes it happens in the tx path that an entry given to the hardware isn't

    around this issue by allowing the driver to also clear out previos entries in

    Interface iteration in mac80211 can be done without holding any

    wouldn't be needed for ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces but
    it's turning out that multi-BSS AP support can be much simpler
    in a driver if ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces can be called
    without holding locks. This converts it to use RCU, it adds a
    requirement that the callback it invokes cannot sleep.

    mac80211: hardware scan rework
    
    The scan code in mac80211 makes the software scan assumption in various
    places. For example, we stop the Tx queue during a software scan so that
    all the Tx packets will be queued by the stack. We also drop frames not
    related to scan in the software scan process. But these are not true for
    hardware scan.
    
    Some wireless hardwares (for example iwl3945/4965) has the ability to
    perform the whole scan process by hardware and/or firmware. The hardware
    scan is relative powerful in that it tries to maintain normal network
    traffic while doing a scan in the background. Some drivers (i.e iwlwifi)
    do provide a way to tune the hardware scan parameters (for example if the
    STA is associated, what's the max time could the STA leave from the
    associated channel, how long the scans get suspended after returning to
    the service channel, etc). But basically this is transparent to the
    stack. mac80211 should not stop Tx queues or drop Rx packets during a
    hardware scan.
    
    This patch resolves the above problem by spliting the current scan
    indicator local->sta_scanning into local->sta_sw_scanning and
    local->sta_hw_scanning. It then changes the scan related code to be aware
    of hardware scan or software scan in various places. With this patch,
    iwlwifi performs much better in the scan-while-associated condition and
    disable_hw_scan=1 should never be required.

    mac80211: provide interface iterator for drivers
    
    Sometimes drivers need to know which interfaces are associated with

    the interfaces that were added, this adds an iteration function to

    As it is intended to be used from the interface add/remove callbacks,
    the iteration function may currently only be called under RTNL.

    loop and replaces it by a sleeping loop.
    
    This patch for b43legacy is patterned aftar the same patch
    for b43 by Michael Buesch <mb@bu3sch.de>.

    b43legacy: Use input-polldev for the rfkill switch
    
    This removes the direct call to rfkill on an rfkill event
    and replaces it with an input device. This way userspace is also
    notified about the event.

    Currently the iwl3945 & iwl4965 drivers share some common Kconfig

    iwlwifi: keep 3945 and 4965 headers separate
    
    The iwl3945 and iwl4965 devices share some common structure, but with a
    lot of difference split all over.  Currently the two drivers share a lot
    of headers and use ugly preprocessor magic to manage the difference.
    
    This patch keeps two entirely separate copies of the headers to get rid
    of these hacks an ease future development.

    This patch do the following 2 things:
    1. Make sure we don't add rate 60M part of supported rate in proble request,
       some AP does not like that.
    2. It is wrong to set priv->active_rate in this function, this will set
       it to all avialable rates which might overwrite the mode supported rate.
       priv->active_rate should be set by only from iwl_set_rate.

    rt2x00: Place mutex around USB register access
    
    There is a buffer, csr_cache which is used to hold copies of data being passed
    to the USB stack which can get corrupted if multiple threads attempt to access
    CSR registers simultaneously. There is also the possibility if multiple
    threads try to access BBP or RF registers for the multiple USB operations
    needed to get interleaved leading to incorrect results. This patch introduces
    a mutex to prevent such simultaneous access. The interleaved access problem
    may also affect the PCI devices but if so that will be handled in a follow-up
    patch.

    rt2x00: Rework rt61 antenna selection.
    
    This patch changes rt61 antenna selection again. It helps at least with the
    rt61 pci card in my box, I hope I haven't broken behaviour on other RF chips.
    RF 2529 antenna setup is incomplete, we need to at code for diversity when we
    figure out how it is done properly.

    rt2x00: Split rt61/rt73 antenna selection into RX and TX antenna
    
    Based on investigation of the legacy drivers, I have made the
    following assumptions of the antenna setup:
     - R77 is the TX antenna configuration
     - RF2529 fetches default antenna selection from NIC eeprom word
    
    With these assumptions we can change the antenna configuration
    to correctly read both antenna setup values and correctly
    configure the antenna. And we can now also configure the antenna
    for RF2529 without a double antenna.

    [PATCH] rt2x00: Implement SW diversity
    
    When mac80211 indicates that the default antenna setup
    should be used _and_ that this default setup is SW_DIVERSITY.
    
    This requires sampling and storing the RSSI per antenna
    and check once every 2 seconds to determine if the RSSI
    has changed significantly. Once this is the case we should sample
    the other antenna for a short period and evaluate if
    we need to swap antenna or not.

    [PATCH] rt2x00: Correctly translate mac80211 antenna setup to rt2x00
    
    mac80211 has 3 values for the antenna setup:
     0 - default
     1 - use antenna 1
     2 - use antenna 2
    
    This means that rt2x00 should store the default value
    from the EEPROM somwhere and use that when mac80211 indicates
    that the antenna setup is 0.
    This also implies that rt2x00 should no longer write the
    hw->config.antenna_sel_* values based on the EEPROM input.
    
    This also adds the basis in rt2x00lib for correct software
    diversity handling. By default rt2x00lib will now configure
    antenna B instead of hardware diversity.

+/* This is an implementation of a TX rate control algorithm that uses a PID
+ * controller. Given a target failed frames rate, the controller decides about
+ * TX rate changes to meet the target failed frames rate.
+ *
+ * The controller basically computes the following:
+ *
+ * adj = CP * err + CI * err_avg + CD * (err - last_err) * (1 + sharpening)
+ *
+ * where
+ * 	adj	adjustment value that is used to switch TX rate (see below)
+ * 	err	current error: target vs. current failed frames percentage
+ * 	last_err	last error
+ * 	err_avg	average (i.e. poor man's integral) of recent errors
+ *	sharpening	non-zero when fast response is needed (i.e. right after
+ *			association or no frames sent for a long time), heading
+ * 			to zero over time
+ * 	CP	Proportional coefficient
+ * 	CI	Integral coefficient
+ * 	CD	Derivative coefficient
+ *
+ * CP, CI, CD are subject to careful tuning.
+ *
+ * The integral component uses a exponential moving average approach instead of
+ * an actual sliding window. The advantage is that we don't need to keep an
+ * array of the last N error values and computation is easier.
+ *
+ * Once we have the adj value, we map it to a rate by means of a learning
+ * algorithm. This algorithm keeps the state of the percentual failed frames
+ * difference between rates. The behaviour of the lowest available rate is kept
+ * as a reference value, and every time we switch between two rates, we compute
+ * the difference between the failed frames each rate exhibited. By doing so,
+ * we compare behaviours which different rates exhibited in adjacent timeslices,
+ * thus the comparison is minimally affected by external conditions. This
+ * difference gets propagated to the whole set of measurements, so that the
+ * reference is always the same. Periodically, we normalize this set so that
+ * recent events weigh the most. By comparing the adj value with this set, we
+ * avoid pejorative switches to lower rates and allow for switches to higher
+ * rates if they behaved well.
+ *
+ * Note that for the computations we use a fixed-point representation to avoid
+ * floating point arithmetic. Hence, all values are shifted left by
+ * RC_PID_ARITH_SHIFT.
+ */
+
+
+/* Shift the adjustment so that we won't switch to a lower rate if it exhibited
+ * a worse failed frames behaviour and we'll choose the highest rate whose
+ * failed frames behaviour is not worse than the one of the original rate
+ * target. While at it, check that the adjustment is within the ranges. Then,
+ * provide the new rate index. */

+ * REPLY_SCAN_CMD = 0x80 (command)
+ *
+ * The hardware scan command is very powerful; the driver can set it up to
+ * maintain (relatively) normal network traffic while doing a scan in the
+ * background.  The max_out_time and suspend_time control the ratio of how
+ * long the device stays on an associated network channel ("service channel")
+ * vs. how long it's away from the service channel, tuned to other channels
+ * for scanning.
+ *
+ * max_out_time is the max time off-channel (in usec), and suspend_time
+ * is how long (in "extended beacon" format) that the scan is "suspended"
+ * after returning to the service channel.  That is, suspend_time is the
+ * time that we stay on the service channel, doing normal work, between
+ * scan segments.  The driver may set these parameters differently to support
+ * scanning when associated vs. not associated, and light vs. heavy traffic
+ * loads when associated.
+ *
+ * After receiving this command, the device's scan engine does the following;
+ *
+ * 1)  Sends SCAN_START notification to driver
+ * 2)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan for one channel
+ * 3)  Sends NULL packet, with power-save (PS) bit set to 1,
+ *     to tell AP that we're going off-channel
+ * 4)  Tunes to first channel in scan list, does active or passive scan
+ * 5)  Sends SCAN_RESULT notification to driver
+ * 6)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan on *next* channel in list
+ * 7)  Repeats 4-6 until it no longer has time to scan the next channel
+ *     before max_out_time expires
+ * 8)  Returns to service channel
+ * 9)  Sends NULL packet with PS=0 to tell AP that we're back
+ * 10) Stays on service channel until suspend_time expires
+ * 11) Repeats entire process 2-10 until list is complete
+ * 12) Sends SCAN_COMPLETE notification
+ *
+ * For fast, efficient scans, the scan command also has support for staying on
+ * a channel for just a short time, if doing active scanning and getting no
+ * responses to the transmitted probe request.  This time is controlled by
+ * quiet_time, and the number of received packets below which a channel is
+ * considered "quiet" is controlled by quiet_plcp_threshold.
+ *
+ * For active scanning on channels that have regulatory restrictions against
+ * blindly transmitting, the scan can listen before transmitting, to make sure
+ * that there is already legitimate activity on the channel.  If enough
+ * packets are cleanly received on the channel (controlled by good_CRC_th,
+ * typical value 1), the scan engine starts transmitting probe requests.
+ *
+ * Driver must use separate scan commands for 2.4 vs. 5 GHz bands.
+ *
+ * To avoid uCode errors, see timing restrictions described under

+ *
+ * The rate scaling procedures described below work well.  Of course, other
+ * procedures are possible, and may work better for particular environments.
+ *
+ *
+ * FILLING THE RATE TABLE
+ *
+ * Given a particular initial rate and mode, as determined by the rate
+ * scaling algorithm described below, the Linux driver uses the following
+ * formula to fill the rs_table[LINK_QUAL_MAX_RETRY_NUM] rate table in the
+ * Link Quality command:
+ *
+ *
+ * 1)  If using High-throughput (HT) (SISO or MIMO) initial rate:
+ *     a) Use this same initial rate for first 3 entries.
+ *     b) Find next lower available rate using same mode (SISO or MIMO),
+ *        use for next 3 entries.  If no lower rate available, switch to
+ *        legacy mode (no FAT channel, no MIMO, no short guard interval).
+ *     c) If using MIMO, set command's mimo_delimiter to number of entries
+ *        using MIMO (3 or 6).
+ *     d) After trying 2 HT rates, switch to legacy mode (no FAT channel,
+ *        no MIMO, no short guard interval), at the next lower bit rate
+ *        (e.g. if second HT bit rate was 54, try 48 legacy), and follow
+ *        legacy procedure for remaining table entries.
+ *
+ * 2)  If using legacy initial rate:
+ *     a) Use the initial rate for only one entry.
+ *     b) For each following entry, reduce the rate to next lower available
+ *        rate, until reaching the lowest available rate.
+ *     c) When reducing rate, also switch antenna selection.
+ *     d) Once lowest available rate is reached, repeat this rate until
+ *        rate table is filled (16 entries), switching antenna each entry.
+ *
+ *
+ * ACCUMULATING HISTORY
+ *
+ * The rate scaling algorithm for 4965, as implemented in Linux driver, uses
+ * two sets of frame Tx success history:  One for the current/active modulation
+ * mode, and one for a speculative/search mode that is being attempted.  If the
+ * speculative mode turns out to be more effective (i.e. actual transfer
+ * rate is better), then the driver continues to use the speculative mode
+ * as the new current active mode.
+ *
+ * Each history set contains, separately for each possible rate, data for a
+ * sliding window of the 62 most recent tx attempts at that rate.  The data
+ * includes a shifting bitmap of success(1)/failure(0), and sums of successful
+ * and attempted frames, from which the driver can additionally calculate a
+ * success ratio (success / attempted) and number of failures
+ * (attempted - success), and control the size of the window (attempted).
+ * The driver uses the bit map to remove successes from the success sum, as
+ * the oldest tx attempts fall out of the window.
+ *
+ * When the 4965 makes multiple tx attempts for a given frame, each attempt
+ * might be at a different rate, and have different modulation characteristics
+ * (e.g. antenna, fat channel, short guard interval), as set up in the rate
+ * scaling table in the Link Quality command.  The driver must determine
+ * which rate table entry was used for each tx attempt, to determine which
+ * rate-specific history to update, and record only those attempts that
+ * match the modulation characteristics of the history set.
+ *
+ * When using block-ack (aggregation), all frames are transmitted at the same
+ * rate, since there is no per-attempt acknowledgement from the destination
+ * station.  The Tx response struct iwl_tx_resp indicates the Tx rate in
+ * rate_n_flags field.  After receiving a block-ack, the driver can update
+ * history for the entire block all at once.
+ *
+ *
+ * FINDING BEST STARTING RATE:
+ *
+ * When working with a selected initial modulation mode (see below), the
+ * driver attempts to find a best initial rate.  The initial rate is the
+ * first entry in the Link Quality command's rate table.
+ *
+ * 1)  Calculate actual throughput (success ratio * expected throughput, see
+ *     table below) for current initial rate.  Do this only if enough frames
+ *     have been attempted to make the value meaningful:  at least 6 failed
+ *     tx attempts, or at least 8 successes.  If not enough, don't try rate
+ *     scaling yet.
+ *
+ * 2)  Find available rates adjacent to current initial rate.  Available means:
+ *     a)  supported by hardware &&
+ *     b)  supported by association &&
+ *     c)  within any constraints selected by user
+ *
+ * 3)  Gather measured throughputs for adjacent rates.  These might not have
+ *     enough history to calculate a throughput.  That's okay, we might try
+ *     using one of them anyway!
+ *
+ * 4)  Try decreasing rate if, for current rate:
+ *     a)  success ratio is < 15% ||
+ *     b)  lower adjacent rate has better measured throughput ||
+ *     c)  higher adjacent rate has worse throughput, and lower is unmeasured
+ *
+ *     As a sanity check, if decrease was determined above, leave rate
+ *     unchanged if:
+ *     a)  lower rate unavailable
+ *     b)  success ratio at current rate > 85% (very good)
+ *     c)  current measured throughput is better than expected throughput
+ *         of lower rate (under perfect 100% tx conditions, see table below)
+ *
+ * 5)  Try increasing rate if, for current rate:
+ *     a)  success ratio is < 15% ||
+ *     b)  both adjacent rates' throughputs are unmeasured (try it!) ||
+ *     b)  higher adjacent rate has better measured throughput ||
+ *     c)  lower adjacent rate has worse throughput, and higher is unmeasured
+ *
+ *     As a sanity check, if increase was determined above, leave rate
+ *     unchanged if:
+ *     a)  success ratio at current rate < 70%.  This is not particularly
+ *         good performance; higher rate is sure to have poorer success.
+ *
+ * 6)  Re-evaluate the rate after each tx frame.  If working with block-
+ *     acknowledge, history and statistics may be calculated for the entire
+ *     block (including prior history that fits within the history windows),
+ *     before re-evaluation.
+ *
+ * FINDING BEST STARTING MODULATION MODE:
+ *
+ * After working with a modulation mode for a "while" (and doing rate scaling),
+ * the driver searches for a new initial mode in an attempt to improve
+ * throughput.  The "while" is measured by numbers of attempted frames:
+ *
+ * For legacy mode, search for new mode after:
+ *   480 successful frames, or 160 failed frames
+ * For high-throughput modes (SISO or MIMO), search for new mode after:
+ *   4500 successful frames, or 400 failed frames
+ *
+ * Mode switch possibilities are (3 for each mode):
+ *
+ * For legacy:
+ *   Change antenna, try SISO (if HT association), try MIMO (if HT association)
+ * For SISO:
+ *   Change antenna, try MIMO, try shortened guard interval (SGI)
+ * For MIMO:
+ *   Try SISO antenna A, SISO antenna B, try shortened guard interval (SGI)
+ *
+ * When trying a new mode, use the same bit rate as the old/current mode when
+ * trying antenna switches and shortened guard interval.  When switching to
+ * SISO from MIMO or legacy, or to MIMO from SISO or legacy, use a rate
+ * for which the expected throughput (under perfect conditions) is about the
+ * same or slightly better than the actual measured throughput delivered by
+ * the old/current mode.
+ *
+ * Actual throughput can be estimated by multiplying the expected throughput
+ * by the success ratio (successful / attempted tx frames).  Frame size is
+ * not considered in this calculation; it assumes that frame size will average
+ * out to be fairly consistent over several samples.  The following are
+ * metric values for expected throughput assuming 100% success ratio.
+ * Only G band has support for CCK rates:
+ *
+ *           RATE:  1    2    5   11    6   9   12   18   24   36   48   54   60

+ *
+ * After the new mode has been tried for a short while (minimum of 6 failed
+ * frames or 8 successful frames), compare success ratio and actual throughput
+ * estimate of the new mode with the old.  If either is better with the new
+ * mode, continue to use the new mode.
+ *
+ * Continue comparing modes until all 3 possibilities have been tried.
+ * If moving from legacy to HT, try all 3 possibilities from the new HT
+ * mode.  After trying all 3, a best mode is found.  Continue to use this mode
+ * for the longer "while" described above (e.g. 480 successful frames for
+ * legacy), and then repeat the search process.

+ * REPLY_SCAN_CMD = 0x80 (command)
+ *
+ * The hardware scan command is very powerful; the driver can set it up to
+ * maintain (relatively) normal network traffic while doing a scan in the
+ * background.  The max_out_time and suspend_time control the ratio of how
+ * long the device stays on an associated network channel ("service channel")
+ * vs. how long it's away from the service channel, i.e. tuned to other channels
+ * for scanning.
+ *
+ * max_out_time is the max time off-channel (in usec), and suspend_time
+ * is how long (in "extended beacon" format) that the scan is "suspended"
+ * after returning to the service channel.  That is, suspend_time is the
+ * time that we stay on the service channel, doing normal work, between
+ * scan segments.  The driver may set these parameters differently to support
+ * scanning when associated vs. not associated, and light vs. heavy traffic
+ * loads when associated.
+ *
+ * After receiving this command, the device's scan engine does the following;
+ *
+ * 1)  Sends SCAN_START notification to driver
+ * 2)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan for one channel
+ * 3)  Sends NULL packet, with power-save (PS) bit set to 1,
+ *     to tell AP that we're going off-channel
+ * 4)  Tunes to first channel in scan list, does active or passive scan
+ * 5)  Sends SCAN_RESULT notification to driver
+ * 6)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan on *next* channel in list
+ * 7)  Repeats 4-6 until it no longer has time to scan the next channel
+ *     before max_out_time expires
+ * 8)  Returns to service channel
+ * 9)  Sends NULL packet with PS=0 to tell AP that we're back
+ * 10) Stays on service channel until suspend_time expires
+ * 11) Repeats entire process 2-10 until list is complete
+ * 12) Sends SCAN_COMPLETE notification
+ *
+ * For fast, efficient scans, the scan command also has support for staying on
+ * a channel for just a short time, if doing active scanning and getting no
+ * responses to the transmitted probe request.  This time is controlled by
+ * quiet_time, and the number of received packets below which a channel is
+ * considered "quiet" is controlled by quiet_plcp_threshold.
+ *
+ * For active scanning on channels that have regulatory restrictions against
+ * blindly transmitting, the scan can listen before transmitting, to make sure
+ * that there is already legitimate activity on the channel.  If enough
+ * packets are cleanly received on the channel (controlled by good_CRC_th,
+ * typical value 1), the scan engine starts transmitting probe requests.
+ *
+ * Driver must use separate scan commands for 2.4 vs. 5 GHz bands.
+ *
+ * To avoid uCode errors, see timing restrictions described under

+ *
+ *****************************************************************************/
+
+/**
+ * SENSITIVITY_CMD = 0xa8 (command, has simple generic response)
+ *
+ * This command sets up the Rx signal detector for a sensitivity level that
+ * is high enough to lock onto all signals within the associated network,
+ * but low enough to ignore signals that are below a certain threshold, so as
+ * not to have too many "false alarms".  False alarms are signals that the
+ * Rx DSP tries to lock onto, but then discards after determining that they
+ * are noise.
+ *
+ * The optimum number of false alarms is between 5 and 50 per 200 TUs
+ * (200 * 1024 uSecs, i.e. 204.8 milliseconds) of actual Rx time (i.e.
+ * time listening, not transmitting).  Driver must adjust sensitivity so that
+ * the ratio of actual false alarms to actual Rx time falls within this range.
+ *
+ * While associated, uCode delivers STATISTICS_NOTIFICATIONs after each
+ * received beacon.  These provide information to the driver to analyze the
+ * sensitivity.  Don't analyze statistics that come in from scanning, or any
+ * other non-associated-network source.  Pertinent statistics include:
+ *
+ * From "general" statistics (struct statistics_rx_non_phy):
+ *
+ * (beacon_energy_[abc] & 0x0FF00) >> 8 (unsigned, higher value is lower level)
+ *   Measure of energy of desired signal.  Used for establishing a level
+ *   below which the device does not detect signals.
+ *
+ * (beacon_silence_rssi_[abc] & 0x0FF00) >> 8 (unsigned, units in dB)
+ *   Measure of background noise in silent period after beacon.
+ *
+ * channel_load
+ *   uSecs of actual Rx time during beacon period (varies according to
+ *   how much time was spent transmitting).
+ *
+ * From "cck" and "ofdm" statistics (struct statistics_rx_phy), separately:
+ *
+ * false_alarm_cnt
+ *   Signal locks abandoned early (before phy-level header).
+ *
+ * plcp_err
+ *   Signal locks abandoned late (during phy-level header).
+ *
+ * NOTE:  Both false_alarm_cnt and plcp_err increment monotonically from
+ *        beacon to beacon, i.e. each value is an accumulation of all errors
+ *        before and including the latest beacon.  Values will wrap around to 0
+ *        after counting up to 2^32 - 1.  Driver must differentiate vs.
+ *        previous beacon's values to determine # false alarms in the current
+ *        beacon period.
+ *
+ * Total number of false alarms = false_alarms + plcp_errs
+ *
+ * For OFDM, adjust the following table entries in struct iwl_sensitivity_cmd
+ * (notice that the start points for OFDM are at or close to settings for
+ * maximum sensitivity):
+ *
+ *                                             START  /  MIN  /  MAX
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR32_X1_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX          90   /   85  /  120
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR32_X1_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX     170   /  170  /  210
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR32_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX         105   /  105  /  140
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR32_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX     220   /  220  /  270
+ *
+ *   If actual rate of OFDM false alarms (+ plcp_errors) is too high
+ *   (greater than 50 for each 204.8 msecs listening), reduce sensitivity
+ *   by *adding* 1 to all 4 of the table entries above, up to the max for
+ *   each entry.  Conversely, if false alarm rate is too low (less than 5
+ *   for each 204.8 msecs listening), *subtract* 1 from each entry to
+ *   increase sensitivity.
+ *
+ * For CCK sensitivity, keep track of the following:
+ *
+ *   1).  20-beacon history of maximum background noise, indicated by
+ *        (beacon_silence_rssi_[abc] & 0x0FF00), units in dB, across the
+ *        3 receivers.  For any given beacon, the "silence reference" is
+ *        the maximum of last 60 samples (20 beacons * 3 receivers).
+ *
+ *   2).  10-beacon history of strongest signal level, as indicated
+ *        by (beacon_energy_[abc] & 0x0FF00) >> 8, across the 3 receivers,
+ *        i.e. the strength of the signal through the best receiver at the
+ *        moment.  These measurements are "upside down", with lower values
+ *        for stronger signals, so max energy will be *minimum* value.
+ *
+ *        Then for any given beacon, the driver must determine the *weakest*
+ *        of the strongest signals; this is the minimum level that needs to be
+ *        successfully detected, when using the best receiver at the moment.
+ *        "Max cck energy" is the maximum (higher value means lower energy!)
+ *        of the last 10 minima.  Once this is determined, driver must add
+ *        a little margin by adding "6" to it.
+ *
+ *   3).  Number of consecutive beacon periods with too few false alarms.
+ *        Reset this to 0 at the first beacon period that falls within the
+ *        "good" range (5 to 50 false alarms per 204.8 milliseconds rx).
+ *
+ * Then, adjust the following CCK table entries in struct iwl_sensitivity_cmd
+ * (notice that the start points for CCK are at maximum sensitivity):
+ *
+ *                                             START  /  MIN  /  MAX
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX         125   /  125  /  200
+ *   HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX     200   /  200  /  400
+ *   HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX                100   /    0  /  100
+ *
+ *   If actual rate of CCK false alarms (+ plcp_errors) is too high
+ *   (greater than 50 for each 204.8 msecs listening), method for reducing
+ *   sensitivity is:
+ *
+ *   1)  *Add* 3 to value in HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX,
+ *       up to max 400.
+ *
+ *   2)  If current value in HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX is < 160,
+ *       sensitivity has been reduced a significant amount; bring it up to
+ *       a moderate 161.  Otherwise, *add* 3, up to max 200.
+ *
+ *   3)  a)  If current value in HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX is > 160,
+ *       sensitivity has been reduced only a moderate or small amount;
+ *       *subtract* 2 from value in HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX,
+ *       down to min 0.  Otherwise (if gain has been significantly reduced),
+ *       don't change the HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX value.
+ *
+ *       b)  Save a snapshot of the "silence reference".
+ *
+ *   If actual rate of CCK false alarms (+ plcp_errors) is too low
+ *   (less than 5 for each 204.8 msecs listening), method for increasing
+ *   sensitivity is used only if:
+ *
+ *   1a)  Previous beacon did not have too many false alarms
+ *   1b)  AND difference between previous "silence reference" and current
+ *        "silence reference" (prev - current) is 2 or more,
+ *   OR 2)  100 or more consecutive beacon periods have had rate of
+ *          less than 5 false alarms per 204.8 milliseconds rx time.
+ *
+ *   Method for increasing sensitivity:
+ *
+ *   1)  *Subtract* 3 from value in HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX,
+ *       down to min 125.
+ *
+ *   2)  *Subtract* 3 from value in HD_AUTO_CORR40_X4_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX,
+ *       down to min 200.
+ *
+ *   3)  *Add* 2 to value in HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX, up to max 100.
+ *
+ *   If actual rate of CCK false alarms (+ plcp_errors) is within good range
+ *   (between 5 and 50 for each 204.8 msecs listening):
+ *
+ *   1)  Save a snapshot of the silence reference.
+ *
+ *   2)  If previous beacon had too many CCK false alarms (+ plcp_errors),
+ *       give some extra margin to energy threshold by *subtracting* 8
+ *       from value in HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX.
+ *
+ *   For all cases (too few, too many, good range), make sure that the CCK
+ *   detection threshold (energy) is below the energy level for robust
+ *   detection over the past 10 beacon periods, the "Max cck energy".
+ *   Lower values mean higher energy; this means making sure that the value
+ *   in HD_MIN_ENERGY_CCK_DET_INDEX is at or *above* "Max cck energy".
+ *
+ * Driver should set the following entries to fixed values:
+ *
+ *   HD_MIN_ENERGY_OFDM_DET_INDEX               100
+ *   HD_BARKER_CORR_TH_ADD_MIN_INDEX            190
+ *   HD_BARKER_CORR_TH_ADD_MIN_MRC_INDEX        390

+ * REPLY_PHY_CALIBRATION_CMD = 0xb0 (command, has simple generic response)

+ * This command sets the relative gains of 4965's 3 radio receiver chains.
+ *
+ * After the first association, driver should accumulate signal and noise
+ * statistics from the STATISTICS_NOTIFICATIONs that follow the first 20
+ * beacons from the associated network (don't collect statistics that come
+ * in from scanning, or any other non-network source).
+ *
+ * DISCONNECTED ANTENNA:
+ *
+ * Driver should determine which antennas are actually connected, by comparing
+ * average beacon signal levels for the 3 Rx chains.  Accumulate (add) the
+ * following values over 20 beacons, one accumulator for each of the chains
+ * a/b/c, from struct statistics_rx_non_phy:
+ *
+ * beacon_rssi_[abc] & 0x0FF (unsigned, units in dB)
+ *
+ * Find the strongest signal from among a/b/c.  Compare the other two to the
+ * strongest.  If any signal is more than 15 dB (times 20, unless you
+ * divide the accumulated values by 20) below the strongest, the driver
+ * considers that antenna to be disconnected, and should not try to use that
+ * antenna/chain for Rx or Tx.  If both A and B seem to be disconnected,
+ * driver should declare the stronger one as connected, and attempt to use it
+ * (A and B are the only 2 Tx chains!).
+ *
+ *
+ * RX BALANCE:
+ *
+ * Driver should balance the 3 receivers (but just the ones that are connected
+ * to antennas, see above) for gain, by comparing the average signal levels
+ * detected during the silence after each beacon (background noise).
+ * Accumulate (add) the following values over 20 beacons, one accumulator for
+ * each of the chains a/b/c, from struct statistics_rx_non_phy:
+ *
+ * beacon_silence_rssi_[abc] & 0x0FF (unsigned, units in dB)
+ *
+ * Find the weakest background noise level from among a/b/c.  This Rx chain
+ * will be the reference, with 0 gain adjustment.  Attenuate other channels by
+ * finding noise difference:
+ *
+ * (accum_noise[i] - accum_noise[reference]) / 30
+ *
+ * The "30" adjusts the dB in the 20 accumulated samples to units of 1.5 dB.
+ * For use in diff_gain_[abc] fields of struct iwl_calibration_cmd, the
+ * driver should limit the difference results to a range of 0-3 (0-4.5 dB),
+ * and set bit 2 to indicate "reduce gain".  The value for the reference
+ * (weakest) chain should be "0".
+ *

  * Theory of operation
  *
- * A queue is a circular buffers with 'Read' and 'Write' pointers.
- * 2 empty entries always kept in the buffer to protect from overflow.
+ * A Tx or Rx queue resides in host DRAM, and is comprised of a circular buffer
+ * of buffer descriptors, each of which points to one or more data buffers for
+ * the device to read from or fill.  Driver and device exchange status of each
+ * queue via "read" and "write" pointers.  Driver keeps minimum of 2 empty
+ * entries in each circular buffer, to protect against confusing empty and full
+ * queue states.
+ *
+ * The device reads or writes the data in the queues via the device's several
+ * DMA/FIFO channels.  Each queue is mapped to a single DMA channel.
  *
  * For Tx queue, there are low mark and high mark limits. If, after queuing
  * the packet for Tx, free space become < low mark, Tx queue stopped. When
  * reclaiming packets (on 'tx done IRQ), if free space become > high mark,
  * Tx queue resumed.
  *
- * The IWL operates with six queues, one receive queue in the device's
- * sram, one transmit queue for sending commands to the device firmware,
- * and four transmit queues for data.
+ * The 4965 operates with up to 17 queues:  One receive queue, one transmit
+ * queue (#4) for sending commands to the device firmware, and 15 other
+ * Tx queues that may be mapped to prioritized Tx DMA/FIFO channels.
+ *
+ * See more detailed info in iwl-4965-hw.h.

+
+/**
+ * To calculate a txpower setting for a given desired target txpower, channel,
+ * modulation bit rate, and transmitter chain (4965 has 2 transmitters to
+ * support MIMO and transmit diversity), driver must do the following:
+ *
+ * 1)  Compare desired txpower vs. (EEPROM) regulatory limit for this channel.
+ *     Do not exceed regulatory limit; reduce target txpower if necessary.
+ *
+ *     If setting up txpowers for MIMO rates (rate indexes 8-15, 24-31),
+ *     2 transmitters will be used simultaneously; driver must reduce the
+ *     regulatory limit by 3 dB (half-power) for each transmitter, so the
+ *     combined total output of the 2 transmitters is within regulatory limits.
+ *
+ *
+ * 2)  Compare target txpower vs. (EEPROM) saturation txpower *reduced by
+ *     backoff for this bit rate*.  Do not exceed (saturation - backoff[rate]);
+ *     reduce target txpower if necessary.
+ *
+ *     Backoff values below are in 1/2 dB units (equivalent to steps in
+ *     txpower gain tables):
+ *
+ *     OFDM 6 - 36 MBit:  10 steps (5 dB)
+ *     OFDM 48 MBit:      15 steps (7.5 dB)
+ *     OFDM 54 MBit:      17 steps (8.5 dB)
+ *     OFDM 60 MBit:      20 steps (10 dB)
+ *     CCK all rates:     10 steps (5 dB)
+ *
+ *     Backoff values apply to saturation txpower on a per-transmitter basis;
+ *     when using MIMO (2 transmitters), each transmitter uses the same
+ *     saturation level provided in EEPROM, and the same backoff values;
+ *     no reduction (such as with regulatory txpower limits) is required.
+ *
+ *     Saturation and Backoff values apply equally to 20 Mhz (legacy) channel
+ *     widths and 40 Mhz (.11n fat) channel widths; there is no separate
+ *     factory measurement for fat channels.
+ *
+ *     The result of this step is the final target txpower.  The rest of
+ *     the steps figure out the proper settings for the device to achieve
+ *     that target txpower.
+ *
+ *
+ * 3)  Determine (EEPROM) calibration subband for the target channel, by
+ *     comparing against first and last channels in each subband
+ *     (see struct iwl4965_eeprom_calib_subband_info).
+ *
+ *
+ * 4)  Linearly interpolate (EEPROM) factory calibration measurement sets,
+ *     referencing the 2 factory-measured (sample) channels within the subband.
+ *
+ *     Interpolation is based on difference between target channel's frequency
+ *     and the sample channels' frequencies.  Since channel numbers are based
+ *     on frequency (5 MHz between each channel number), this is equivalent
+ *     to interpolating based on channel number differences.
+ *
+ *     Note that the sample channels may or may not be the channels at the
+ *     edges of the subband.  The target channel may be "outside" of the
+ *     span of the sampled channels.
+ *
+ *     Driver may choose the pair (for 2 Tx chains) of measurements (see
+ *     struct iwl4965_eeprom_calib_ch_info) for which the actual measured
+ *     txpower comes closest to the desired txpower.  Usually, though,
+ *     the middle set of measurements is closest to the regulatory limits,
+ *     and is therefore a good choice for all txpower calculations (this
+ *     assumes that high accuracy is needed for maximizing legal txpower,
+ *     while lower txpower configurations do not need as much accuracy).
+ *
+ *     Driver should interpolate both members of the chosen measurement pair,
+ *     i.e. for both Tx chains (radio transmitters), unless the driver knows
+ *     that only one of the chains will be used (e.g. only one tx antenna
+ *     connected, but this should be unusual).  The rate scaling algorithm
+ *     switches antennas to find best performance, so both Tx chains will
+ *     be used (although only one at a time) even for non-MIMO transmissions.
+ *
+ *     Driver should interpolate factory values for temperature, gain table
+ *     index, and actual power.  The power amplifier detector values are
+ *     not used by the driver.
+ *
+ *     Sanity check:  If the target channel happens to be one of the sample
+ *     channels, the results should agree with the sample channel's
+ *     measurements!
+ *
+ *
+ * 5)  Find difference between desired txpower and (interpolated)
+ *     factory-measured txpower.  Using (interpolated) factory gain table index
+ *     (shown elsewhere) as a starting point, adjust this index lower to
+ *     increase txpower, or higher to decrease txpower, until the target
+ *     txpower is reached.  Each step in the gain table is 1/2 dB.
+ *
+ *     For example, if factory measured txpower is 16 dBm, and target txpower
+ *     is 13 dBm, add 6 steps to the factory gain index to reduce txpower
+ *     by 3 dB.
+ *
+ *
+ * 6)  Find difference between current device temperature and (interpolated)
+ *     factory-measured temperature for sub-band.  Factory values are in
+ *     degrees Celsius.  To calculate current temperature, see comments for
+ *     "4965 temperature calculation".
+ *
+ *     If current temperature is higher than factory temperature, driver must
+ *     increase gain (lower gain table index), and vice versa.
+ *
+ *     Temperature affects gain differently for different channels:
+ *
+ *     2.4 GHz all channels:  3.5 degrees per half-dB step
+ *     5 GHz channels 34-43:  4.5 degrees per half-dB step
+ *     5 GHz channels >= 44:  4.0 degrees per half-dB step
+ *
+ *     NOTE:  Temperature can increase rapidly when transmitting, especially
+ *            with heavy traffic at high txpowers.  Driver should update
+ *            temperature calculations often under these conditions to
+ *            maintain strong txpower in the face of rising temperature.
+ *
+ *
+ * 7)  Find difference between current power supply voltage indicator
+ *     (from "initialize alive") and factory-measured power supply voltage
+ *     indicator (EEPROM).
+ *
+ *     If the current voltage is higher (indicator is lower) than factory
+ *     voltage, gain should be reduced (gain table index increased) by:
+ *
+ *     (eeprom - current) / 7
+ *
+ *     If the current voltage is lower (indicator is higher) than factory
+ *     voltage, gain should be increased (gain table index decreased) by:
+ *
+ *     2 * (current - eeprom) / 7
+ *
+ *     If number of index steps in either direction turns out to be > 2,
+ *     something is wrong ... just use 0.
+ *
+ *     NOTE:  Voltage compensation is independent of band/channel.
+ *
+ *     NOTE:  "Initialize" uCode measures current voltage, which is assumed
+ *            to be constant after this initial measurement.  Voltage
+ *            compensation for txpower (number of steps in gain table)
+ *            may be calculated once and used until the next uCode bootload.
+ *
+ *
+ * 8)  If setting up txpowers for MIMO rates (rate indexes 8-15, 24-31),
+ *     adjust txpower for each transmitter chain, so txpower is balanced
+ *     between the two chains.  There are 5 pairs of tx_atten[group][chain]
+ *     values in "initialize alive", one pair for each of 5 channel ranges:
+ *
+ *     Group 0:  5 GHz channel 34-43
+ *     Group 1:  5 GHz channel 44-70
+ *     Group 2:  5 GHz channel 71-124
+ *     Group 3:  5 GHz channel 125-200
+ *     Group 4:  2.4 GHz all channels
+ *
+ *     Add the tx_atten[group][chain] value to the index for the target chain.
+ *     The values are signed, but are in pairs of 0 and a non-negative number,
+ *     so as to reduce gain (if necessary) of the "hotter" channel.  This
+ *     avoids any need to double-check for regulatory compliance after
+ *     this step.
+ *
+ *
+ * 9)  If setting up for a CCK rate, lower the gain by adding a CCK compensation
+ *     value to the index:
+ *
+ *     Hardware rev B:  9 steps (4.5 dB)
+ *     Hardware rev C:  5 steps (2.5 dB)
+ *
+ *     Hardware rev for 4965 can be determined by reading CSR_HW_REV_WA_REG,
+ *     bits [3:2], 1 = B, 2 = C.
+ *
+ *     NOTE:  This compensation is in addition to any saturation backoff that
+ *            might have been applied in an earlier step.
+ *
+ *
+ * 10) Select the gain table, based on band (2.4 vs 5 GHz).
+ *
+ *     Limit the adjusted index to stay within the table!
+ *
+ *
+ * 11) Read gain table entries for DSP and radio gain, place into appropriate
+ *     location(s) in command (struct iwl4965_txpowertable_cmd).

+ * Rx SRAM Control and Status Registers (RSCSR)
+ *
+ * These registers provide handshake between driver and 4965 for the Rx queue
+ * (this queue handles *all* command responses, notifications, Rx data, etc.
+ * sent from 4965 uCode to host driver).  Unlike Tx, there is only one Rx
+ * queue, and only one Rx DMA/FIFO channel.  Also unlike Tx, which can
+ * concatenate up to 20 DRAM buffers to form a Tx frame, each Receive Buffer
+ * Descriptor (RBD) points to only one Rx Buffer (RB); there is a 1:1
+ * mapping between RBDs and RBs.
+ *
+ * Driver must allocate host DRAM memory for the following, and set the
+ * physical address of each into 4965 registers:
+ *
+ * 1)  Receive Buffer Descriptor (RBD) circular buffer (CB), typically with 256
+ *     entries (although any power of 2, up to 4096, is selectable by driver).
+ *     Each entry (1 dword) points to a receive buffer (RB) of consistent size
+ *     (typically 4K, although 8K or 16K are also selectable by driver).
+ *     Driver sets up RB size and number of RBDs in the CB via Rx config
+ *     register FH_MEM_RCSR_CHNL0_CONFIG_REG.
+ *
+ *     Bit fields within one RBD:
+ *     27-0:  Receive Buffer physical address bits [35:8], 256-byte aligned
+ *
+ *     Driver sets physical address [35:8] of base of RBD circular buffer
+ *     into FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_RBDCB_BASE_REG [27:0].
+ *
+ * 2)  Rx status buffer, 8 bytes, in which 4965 indicates which Rx Buffers
+ *     (RBs) have been filled, via a "write pointer", actually the index of
+ *     the RB's corresponding RBD within the circular buffer.  Driver sets
+ *     physical address [35:4] into FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_STTS_WPTR_REG [31:0].
+ *
+ *     Bit fields in lower dword of Rx status buffer (upper dword not used
+ *     by driver; see struct iwl4965_shared, val0):
+ *     31-12:  Not used by driver
+ *     11- 0:  Index of last filled Rx buffer descriptor
+ *             (4965 writes, driver reads this value)
+ *
+ * As the driver prepares Receive Buffers (RBs) for 4965 to fill, driver must
+ * enter pointers to these RBs into contiguous RBD circular buffer entries,
+ * and update the 4965's "write" index register, FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_RBDCB_WPTR_REG.
+ *
+ * This "write" index corresponds to the *next* RBD that the driver will make
+ * available, i.e. one RBD past the tail of the ready-to-fill RBDs within
+ * the circular buffer.  This value should initially be 0 (before preparing any
+ * RBs), should be 8 after preparing the first 8 RBs (for example), and must
+ * wrap back to 0 at the end of the circular buffer (but don't wrap before
+ * "read" index has advanced past 1!  See below).
+ * NOTE:  4965 EXPECTS THE WRITE INDEX TO BE INCREMENTED IN MULTIPLES OF 8.
+ *
+ * As the 4965 fills RBs (referenced from contiguous RBDs within the circular
+ * buffer), it updates the Rx status buffer in host DRAM, 2) described above,
+ * to tell the driver the index of the latest filled RBD.  The driver must
+ * read this "read" index from DRAM after receiving an Rx interrupt from 4965.
+ *
+ * The driver must also internally keep track of a third index, which is the
+ * next RBD to process.  When receiving an Rx interrupt, driver should process
+ * all filled but unprocessed RBs up to, but not including, the RB
+ * corresponding to the "read" index.  For example, if "read" index becomes "1",
+ * driver may process the RB pointed to by RBD 0.  Depending on volume of
+ * traffic, there may be many RBs to process.
+ *
+ * If read index == write index, 4965 thinks there is no room to put new data.
+ * Due to this, the maximum number of filled RBs is 255, instead of 256.  To
+ * be safe, make sure that there is a gap of at least 2 RBDs between "write"
+ * and "read" indexes; that is, make sure that there are no more than 254
+ * buffers waiting to be filled.

+/********************* START TX SCHEDULER *************************************/
 
+/**
+ * 4965 Tx Scheduler
+ *
+ * The Tx Scheduler selects the next frame to be transmitted, chosing TFDs
+ * (Transmit Frame Descriptors) from up to 16 circular Tx queues resident in
+ * host DRAM.  It steers each frame's Tx command (which contains the frame
+ * data) into one of up to 7 prioritized Tx DMA FIFO channels within the
+ * device.  A queue maps to only one (selectable by driver) Tx DMA channel,
+ * but one DMA channel may take input from several queues.
+ *
+ * Tx DMA channels have dedicated purposes.  For 4965, they are used as follows:
+ *
+ * 0 -- EDCA BK (background) frames, lowest priority
+ * 1 -- EDCA BE (best effort) frames, normal priority
+ * 2 -- EDCA VI (video) frames, higher priority
+ * 3 -- EDCA VO (voice) and management frames, highest priority
+ * 4 -- Commands (e.g. RXON, etc.)
+ * 5 -- HCCA short frames
+ * 6 -- HCCA long frames
+ * 7 -- not used by driver (device-internal only)
+ *
+ * Driver should normally map queues 0-6 to Tx DMA/FIFO channels 0-6.
+ * In addition, driver can map queues 7-15 to Tx DMA/FIFO channels 0-3 to
+ * support 11n aggregation via EDCA DMA channels.
+ *
+ * The driver sets up each queue to work in one of two modes:
+ *
+ * 1)  Scheduler-Ack, in which the scheduler automatically supports a
+ *     block-ack (BA) window of up to 64 TFDs.  In this mode, each queue
+ *     contains TFDs for a unique combination of Recipient Address (RA)
+ *     and Traffic Identifier (TID), that is, traffic of a given
+ *     Quality-Of-Service (QOS) priority, destined for a single station.
+ *
+ *     In scheduler-ack mode, the scheduler keeps track of the Tx status of
+ *     each frame within the BA window, including whether it's been transmitted,
+ *     and whether it's been acknowledged by the receiving station.  The device
+ *     automatically processes block-acks received from the receiving STA,
+ *     and reschedules un-acked frames to be retransmitted (successful
+ *     Tx completion may end up being out-of-order).
+ *
+ *     The driver must maintain the queue's Byte Count table in host DRAM
+ *     (struct iwl4965_sched_queue_byte_cnt_tbl) for this mode.
+ *     This mode does not support fragmentation.
+ *
+ * 2)  FIFO (a.k.a. non-Scheduler-ACK), in which each TFD is processed in order.
+ *     The device may automatically retry Tx, but will retry only one frame
+ *     at a time, until receiving ACK from receiving station, or reaching
+ *     retry limit and giving up.
+ *
+ *     The command queue (#4) must use this mode!
+ *     This mode does not require use of the Byte Count table in host DRAM.
+ *
+ * Driver controls scheduler operation via 3 means:
+ * 1)  Scheduler registers
+ * 2)  Shared scheduler data base in internal 4956 SRAM
+ * 3)  Shared data in host DRAM
+ *
+ * Initialization:
+ *
+ * When loading, driver should allocate memory for:
+ * 1)  16 TFD circular buffers, each with space for (typically) 256 TFDs.
+ * 2)  16 Byte Count circular buffers in 16 KBytes contiguous memory
+ *     (1024 bytes for each queue).
+ *
+ * After receiving "Alive" response from uCode, driver must initialize
+ * the scheduler (especially for queue #4, the command queue, otherwise
+ * the driver can't issue commands!):
+ */
+
+/**
+ * Max Tx window size is the max number of contiguous TFDs that the scheduler
+ * can keep track of at one time when creating block-ack chains of frames.
+ * Note that "64" matches the number of ack bits in a block-ack packet.
+ * Driver should use SCD_WIN_SIZE and SCD_FRAME_LIMIT values to initialize

+ * controller (uCode) are via the command queue (one of the Tx queues).  All
+ * uCode command responses/replies/notifications, including Rx frames, are
+ * conveyed from uCode to driver via the Rx queue.
+ *
+ * Most support for these queues, including handshake support, resides in
+ * structures in host DRAM, shared between the driver and the device.  When
+ * allocating this memory, the driver must make sure that data written by
+ * the host CPU updates DRAM immediately (and does not get "stuck" in CPU's
+ * cache memory), so DRAM and cache are consistent, and the device can
+ * immediately see changes made by the driver.
+ *
+ * 4965 supports up to 16 DRAM-based Tx queues, and services these queues via
+ * up to 7 DMA channels (FIFOs).  Each Tx queue is supported by a circular array
+ * in DRAM containing 256 Transmit Frame Descriptors (TFDs).

  * Theory of operation
  *
- * A queue is a circular buffers with 'Read' and 'Write' pointers.
- * 2 empty entries always kept in the buffer to protect from overflow.
+ * A Tx or Rx queue resides in host DRAM, and is comprised of a circular buffer
+ * of buffer descriptors, each of which points to one or more data buffers for
+ * the device to read from or fill.  Driver and device exchange status of each
+ * queue via "read" and "write" pointers.  Driver keeps minimum of 2 empty
+ * entries in each circular buffer, to protect against confusing empty and full
+ * queue states.
+ *
+ * The device reads or writes the data in the queues via the device's several
+ * DMA/FIFO channels.  Each queue is mapped to a single DMA channel.
  *
  * For Tx queue, there are low mark and high mark limits. If, after queuing
  * the packet for Tx, free space become < low mark, Tx queue stopped. When
  * reclaiming packets (on 'tx done IRQ), if free space become > high mark,
  * Tx queue resumed.
  *
- * The IWL operates with six queues, one receive queue in the device's
- * sram, one transmit queue for sending commands to the device firmware,
- * and four transmit queues for data.
+ * The 3945 operates with six queues:  One receive queue, one transmit queue
+ * (#4) for sending commands to the device firmware, and four transmit queues
+ * (#0-3) for data tx via EDCA.  An additional 2 HCCA queues are unused.

+ * the 802.11 specifications demand. In addition, new (proprietary) data rates
+ * are introduced: 3, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 MBit/s.
+ *
+ * Please note that can you either use XR or TURBO but you cannot use both,
+ * they are exclusive.

+/*
+ * Modulation for Atheros' Turbo G and Turbo A, its supposed to provide a
+ * throughput transmission speed up to 40Mbit/s-60Mbit/s at a 108Mbit/s
+ * signaling rate achieved through the bonding of two 54Mbit/s 802.11g
+ * channels. To use this feature your Access Point must also suport it.
+ * There is also a distinction between "static" and "dynamic" turbo modes:
+ *
+ * - Static: is the dumb version: devices set to this mode stick to it until
+ *     the mode is turned off.
+ * - Dynamic: is the intelligent version, the network decides itself if it
+ *     is ok to use turbo. As soon as traffic is detected on adjacent channels
+ *     (which would get used in turbo mode), or when a non-turbo station joins
+ *     the network, turbo mode won't be used until the situation changes again.
+ *     Dynamic mode is achieved by Atheros' Adaptive Radio (AR) feature which
+ *     monitors the used radio band in order to decide whether turbo mode may
+ *     be used or not.
+ *
+ * This article claims Super G sticks to bonding of channels 5 and 6 for
+ * USA:
+ *
+ * http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,113428-page,1/article.html
+ *
+ * The channel bonding seems to be driver specific though. In addition to
+ * deciding what channels will be used, these "Turbo" modes are accomplished
+ * by also enabling the following features:
+ *
+ * - Bursting: allows multiple frames to be sent at once, rather than pausing
+ *     after each frame. Bursting is a standards-compliant feature that can be
+ *     used with any Access Point.
+ * - Fast frames: increases the amount of information that can be sent per
+ *     frame, also resulting in a reduction of transmission overhead. It is a
+ *     proprietary feature that needs to be supported by the Access Point.
+ * - Compression: data frames are compressed in real time using a Lempel Ziv
+ *     algorithm. This is done transparently. Once this feature is enabled,
+ *     compression and decompression takes place inside the chipset, without
+ *     putting additional load on the host CPU.

+ * enum ath5k_int - Hardware interrupt masks helpers
+ *
+ * @AR5K_INT_RX: mask to identify received frame interrupts, of type
+ * 	AR5K_ISR_RXOK or AR5K_ISR_RXERR
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXDESC: Request RX descriptor/Read RX descriptor (?)
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXNOFRM: No frame received (?)
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXEOL: received End Of List for VEOL (Virtual End Of List). The
+ * 	Queue Control Unit (QCU) signals an EOL interrupt only if a descriptor's
+ * 	LinkPtr is NULL. For more details, refer to:
+ * 	http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20030225739.html
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXORN: Indicates we got RX overrun (eg. no more descriptors).
+ * 	Note that Rx overrun is not always fatal, on some chips we can continue
+ * 	operation without reseting the card, that's why int_fatal is not
+ * 	common for all chips.
+ * @AR5K_INT_TX: mask to identify received frame interrupts, of type
+ * 	AR5K_ISR_TXOK or AR5K_ISR_TXERR
+ * @AR5K_INT_TXDESC: Request TX descriptor/Read TX status descriptor (?)
+ * @AR5K_INT_TXURN: received when we should increase the TX trigger threshold
+ * 	We currently do increments on interrupt by
+ * 	(AR5K_TUNE_MAX_TX_FIFO_THRES - current_trigger_level) / 2
+ * @AR5K_INT_MIB: Indicates the Management Information Base counters should be
+ * 	checked. We should do this with ath5k_hw_update_mib_counters() but
+ * 	it seems we should also then do some noise immunity work.
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXPHY: RX PHY Error
+ * @AR5K_INT_RXKCM: ??
+ * @AR5K_INT_SWBA: SoftWare Beacon Alert - indicates its time to send a
+ * 	beacon that must be handled in software. The alternative is if you
+ * 	have VEOL support, in that case you let the hardware deal with things.
+ * @AR5K_INT_BMISS: If in STA mode this indicates we have stopped seeing
+ * 	beacons from the AP have associated with, we should probably try to
+ * 	reassociate. When in IBSS mode this might mean we have not received
+ * 	any beacons from any local stations. Note that every station in an
+ * 	IBSS schedules to send beacons at the Target Beacon Transmission Time
+ * 	(TBTT) with a random backoff.
+ * @AR5K_INT_BNR: Beacon Not Ready interrupt - ??
+ * @AR5K_INT_GPIO: GPIO interrupt is used for RF Kill, disabled for now
+ * 	until properly handled
+ * @AR5K_INT_FATAL: Fatal errors were encountered, typically caused by DMA
+ * 	errors. These types of errors we can enable seem to be of type
+ * 	AR5K_SIMR2_MCABT, AR5K_SIMR2_SSERR and AR5K_SIMR2_DPERR.
+ * @AR5K_INT_GLOBAL: Seems to be used to clear and set the IER
+ * @AR5K_INT_NOCARD: signals the card has been removed
+ * @AR5K_INT_COMMON: common interrupts shared amogst MACs with the same
+ * 	bit value
+ *
+ * These are mapped to take advantage of some common bits
+ * between the MACs, to be able to set intr properties
+ * easier. Some of them are not used yet inside hw.c. Most map
+ * to the respective hw interrupt value as they are common amogst different
+ * MACs.

+ * RF Buffer register
+ *
+ * There are some special control registers on the RF chip
+ * that hold various operation settings related mostly to
+ * the analog parts (channel, gain adjustment etc).
+ *
+ * We don't write on those registers directly but
+ * we send a data packet on the buffer register and
+ * then write on another special register to notify hw
+ * to apply the settings. This is done so that control registers
+ * can be dynamicaly programmed during operation and the settings
+ * are applied faster on the hw.
+ *
+ * We sent such data packets during rf initialization and channel change
+ * through ath5k_hw_rf*_rfregs and ath5k_hw_rf*_channel functions.
+ *
+ * The data packets we send during initializadion are inside ath5k_ini_rf
+ * struct (see ath5k_hw.h) and each one is related to an "rf register bank".
+ * We use *rfregs functions to modify them  acording to current operation
+ * mode and eeprom values and pass them all together to the chip.
+ *
+ * It's obvious from the code that 0x989c is the buffer register but
+ * for the other special registers that we write to after sending each
+ * packet, i have no idea. So i'll name them BUFFER_CONTROL_X registers
+ * for now. It's interesting that they are also used for some other operations.
+ *
+ * Also check out hw.h and U.S. Patent 6677779 B1 (about buffer
+ * registers and control registers):

+/**
+ * ath5k_hw_set_bssid_mask - set common bits we should listen to
+ *
+ * The bssid_mask is a utility used by AR5212 hardware to inform the hardware
+ * which bits of the interface's MAC address should be looked at when trying
+ * to decide which packets to ACK. In station mode every bit matters. In AP
+ * mode with a single BSS every bit matters as well. In AP mode with
+ * multiple BSSes not every bit matters.
+ *
+ * @ah: the &struct ath5k_hw
+ * @mask: the bssid_mask, a u8 array of size ETH_ALEN
+ *
+ * Note that this is a simple filter and *does* not filter out all
+ * relevant frames. Some non-relevant frames will get through, probability
+ * jocks are welcomed to compute.
+ *
+ * When handling multiple BSSes (or VAPs) you can get the BSSID mask by
+ * computing the set of:
+ *
+ *     ~ ( MAC XOR BSSID )
+ *
+ * When you do this you are essentially computing the common bits. Later it
+ * is assumed the harware will "and" (&) the BSSID mask with the MAC address
+ * to obtain the relevant bits which should match on the destination frame.
+ *
+ * Simple example: on your card you have have two BSSes you have created with
+ * BSSID-01 and BSSID-02. Lets assume BSSID-01 will not use the MAC address.
+ * There is another BSSID-03 but you are not part of it. For simplicity's sake,
+ * assuming only 4 bits for a mac address and for BSSIDs you can then have:
+ *
+ *                  \
+ * MAC:                0001 |
+ * BSSID-01:   0100 | --> Belongs to us
+ * BSSID-02:   1001 |
+ *                  /
+ * -------------------
+ * BSSID-03:   0110  | --> External
+ * -------------------
+ *
+ * Our bssid_mask would then be:
+ *
+ *             On loop iteration for BSSID-01:
+ *             ~(0001 ^ 0100)  -> ~(0101)
+ *                             ->   1010
+ *             bssid_mask      =    1010
+ *
+ *             On loop iteration for BSSID-02:
+ *             bssid_mask &= ~(0001   ^   1001)
+ *             bssid_mask =   (1010)  & ~(0001 ^ 1001)
+ *             bssid_mask =   (1010)  & ~(1001)
+ *             bssid_mask =   (1010)  &  (0110)
+ *             bssid_mask =   0010
+ *
+ * A bssid_mask of 0010 means "only pay attention to the second least
+ * significant bit". This is because its the only bit common
+ * amongst the MAC and all BSSIDs we support. To findout what the real
+ * common bit is we can simply "&" the bssid_mask now with any BSSID we have
+ * or our MAC address (we assume the hardware uses the MAC address).
+ *
+ * Now, suppose there's an incoming frame for BSSID-03:
+ *
+ * IFRAME-01:  0110
+ *
+ * An easy eye-inspeciton of this already should tell you that this frame
+ * will not pass our check. This is beacuse the bssid_mask tells the
+ * hardware to only look at the second least significant bit and the
+ * common bit amongst the MAC and BSSIDs is 0, this frame has the 2nd LSB
+ * as 1, which does not match 0.
+ *
+ * So with IFRAME-01 we *assume* the hardware will do:
+ *
+ *     allow = (IFRAME-01 & bssid_mask) == (bssid_mask & MAC) ? 1 : 0;
+ *  --> allow = (0110 & 0010) == (0010 & 0001) ? 1 : 0;
+ *  --> allow = (0010) == 0000 ? 1 : 0;
+ *  --> allow = 0
+ *
+ *  Lets now test a frame that should work:
+ *
+ * IFRAME-02:  0001 (we should allow)
+ *
+ *     allow = (0001 & 1010) == 1010
+ *
+ *     allow = (IFRAME-02 & bssid_mask) == (bssid_mask & MAC) ? 1 : 0;
+ *  --> allow = (0001 & 0010) ==  (0010 & 0001) ? 1 :0;
+ *  --> allow = (0010) == (0010)
+ *  --> allow = 1
+ *
+ * Other examples:
+ *
+ * IFRAME-03:  0100 --> allowed
+ * IFRAME-04:  1001 --> allowed
+ * IFRAME-05:  1101 --> allowed but its not for us!!!
