If the AgentManager instance is created before Akonadi is running, its D-Bus interface is not valid yet.
However, it never becomes valid afterwards, so it never knows any types or instances, even if they are available.

This lead to ServerManager believing that Akonadi did not start correctly, letting it run into the safety timeout and producing a self test log.
Unfortunately this self test log then contains wrong information ("no resource agents found")

BUG: 236538
