# I got frequent problems mainly with scsi-pcmcia-cards on the cardbus. Use
# PCMCIARESTART="yes" to stop the whole pcmcia-subsystem on a suspend and
# to start it again after a resume. This can slow down your suspend and resume
# process. Use PCMCIAWAIT to wait with the suspend until the pccard is removed
# from the system.
# Some BIOSes are too buggy to handle cardctl suspend and cardctl resume
# properly, in these cases cardctl eject and cardctl insert can be used instead.
# However, this actually ejects the card on hardware supporting it, so if
# the BIOS isn't buggy, it shouldn't be used. Set PCMCIABIOSBUG to yes if
# you are experiencing problems with PCMCIA cards after a resume.
# Since buggy BIOSes seem to be far more common than hardware that can eject
# PCMCIA cards (and it doesn't make a difference on systems that don't have
# either), it is enabled by default.
