What's new

In addition to the new toolchain, Foresight 2.0 features:

PackageKit

With the 2.0 release of Foresight, the Foresight System Manager has been officially replaced with PackageKit.  PackageKit aims to be a unified package manager and installer available for many different Linux distributions, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution to ship with PackageKit using the Conary backend. PackageKit is a GUI tool for managing software packages and updates for your computer, including installing, removing or searching for new software.

After a default installation, PackageKit is installed and running on your system.  PackageKit is configured to check for updates once a day, and you will be prompted to install them by clicking on the PackageKit icon on your panel.

To manually search, add or remove software, click on System -> Administration -> Add / Remove Software.

Additional documentation on using PackageKit can be found on the Foresight Linux Wiki at http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/

To start Compiz, type ALT+F2 and type "compiz".  Intel and ATI users may need to update their xorg.conf and switch from vesa to intel and radeon respectively.  Nvidia users should run "sudo conary update nvidia nvidia-kernel" to install the Nvidia drivers.

Syslinux

Syslinux has been added as the default bootloader during installation.  Syslinux is under active development, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution shipping with Syslinux.  After installation and during boot-up, Syslinux will appear as Extlinux at the bootloader screen.  GRUB is still an option during installation.

* NDISWrapper is included in a default installation.

Current Issues

* Pulse Audio is the new audio subsystem in Foresight 2.0, and the latest version is included.  ESD emulation may or may not work and needs testing.

* OpenOffice.org is currently broken, and is not included in the default installation for this reason.

Packages Not Included

* Glipper
* GIMP.  GIMP is not included at this time as we work on trying to get Foresight down to one installation CD.  This will be evaluated for inclusion at a later time.
