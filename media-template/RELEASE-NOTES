Welcome to Foresight Linux!

Welcome to Foresight Linux 1.3 installation process!

Just in time for the new GNOME 2.18.2 the Foresight Linux team is happy and proud to release a new version of its distribution. Foresight continues its path on being a building ground for new concepts and applications. Foresight aims to be the leading GNOME distribution. This does mean more than just being in time with every GNOME release. As a distribution this also means to take users more serious. We also always like to show off some of the new and exciting applications as soon as possible. Although Foresight is very much on the edge of Linux desktop technology it does not mean that it is unstable. We believe that by providing most uptodate software we do provide the bug fixes that the developers suggest, instead of just fixing bugs on outdated software. Foresight Linux also makes it extremely easy to create your own packages with the Conary package manager. So in a sense Foresight combines the powers of many different distributions.
New Features

 * GNOME: This is the third release with a GNOME 2.18 (after 2.18.0 & 2.18.1), so this contains again some minor fixes and improvements.

 * Desktop Search: With Beagle 0.2.17 and some tweaks we introduce some major improvements in our desktop search engine.

 * Web browsing: We upgrade Epiphany web browser to version 2.18.2.

 * First Boot Process: The outdated Firstboot mechanism has been replaced by our modified version of autoconfig from Knoppix to configure X.Org, and creating the first user is done by Firstrun. This will make it even easier to install Foresight.

 * Chat: ... with Pidgin (renamed GAIM) version 2.0.1. Pidgin supports multiple chat protocols like Jabber, MSN, AIM, ICQ, IRC and more.

 * HAL: was updated to 0.5.9.  HAL, the Hardware Abstraction Layer, has updates for a number of devices. This should make Foresight more rock-solid.

 * X.Org 7.2: The new graphical server allows to forget about configuration files at all for many installation scenarios.

 * Better and newer Compiz 3D window manager.

 * Package Manager: The Conary conary package manager in an improved version 1.1.27.


*Important Bugfixes*

    * More Digital Cameras are now supported to import (issue #143,issue #247 )
    * Gtk is now localized. This means that dialogs like printing and file opening are now available in your local language

*The future*

We hope to bringt out the next mafor release of Foresight Linux as soon as possible. And with that to be able to deliver also a 64bit version. But we are talking about months of work todo, still.
