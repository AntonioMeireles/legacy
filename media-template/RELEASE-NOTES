To make it easier to browse the web Epiphany is now the new default web browser. Epiphany is a fast, lightweight and resource friendly web browser that searches your bookmarks while you type in the address bar. If you prefer, you can alternatively use Firefox 2 with all its extensions.

For users with visual impairments, Foresight comes with a flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive technology: Orca.

With the Evince document viewer you now have a more advanced presentation mode. Evince will also stop the screensaver if one is detected. Evince supports many popular formats: PDF, Postscript Multi-Page TIFF, DVI, DjVu, Impress.

Tomboy note taking application now supports: bullet point support, search, pin notes and backlinks.

Foresight is providing a faster search with the combination of Beagle via the Deskbar (that now supports Drag & Drop and Firefox 2 search engines). By typing search terms into the Deskbar entry in your panel you are presented with the search results as you type.

Seahorse lets you manage many kinds of keys and passwords. Seahorse enables you to encrypt, sign, decrypt and verify the contents of the clipboard.

*Miscellaneous*

The GNOME Power Manager can now control processor frequency scaling, and save additional battery power, in addition to using less system memory. The Volume Control now has a reasonable layout for advanced sound cards, such as the Audigy 2. System Preferences has also received a major cleanup – autostart applications are now easier to find and much more.
Fun

There are two new GNOME games:

* a Chess game (glChess)

* and a Sudoku game (GnomeSudoku)

And the games Gnibbles, Iagno and Four-in-a-Row now have Internet multiplayer support!
