What's new

In addition to a new toolchain, Foresight 2.0 features:

PackageKit

With the 2.0 release of Foresight, the Foresight System Manager has been officially replaced with PackageKit.  PackageKit aims to be a unified package manager and installer available for many different Linux distributions, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution to ship with PackageKit using the Conary backend. PackageKit is a GUI tool for managing software packages and updates for your computer, including installing, removing or searching for new software.

After a default installation, PackageKit is installed and running on your system.  PackageKit is configured to check for updates once a day, and you will be prompted to install them by clicking on the PackageKit icon on your panel.

To manually search, add or remove software, click on System -> Administration -> Add / Remove Software.

Additional documentation on using PackageKit can be found on the Foresight Linux Wiki at http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/

Compiz Fusion

The Foresight Alpha includes a new group build of the Xorg stack and Compiz Fusion.  Users should see speed improvements with all three major graphics cards, including Nvidia, ATI and Intel.  Fusion Icon has been deprecated in Foresight 2.0.

To start Compiz, press and hold ALT+F2 and type "compiz".  Intel and ATI users may need to update their xorg.conf and switch from vesa to intel and radeon respectively.  Nvidia users should run "sudo conary update nvidia nvidia-kernel" to install the Nvidia drivers.

Syslinux

Syslinux has been added as the default bootloader during installation.  Syslinux is under active development, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution shipping with Syslinux.  After installation and during boot-up, Syslinux will appear as Extlinux at the bootloader screen.  GRUB is still an option during installation.

Misc. Updates

* Flash is fixed and included in the default 32 bit installation
* The ipw3945 Intel wireless drivers are fixed and working with Network Manager.
* GNOME-DO is included in the default installation and started in a user's session.  To bring up GNOME-DO press Super+spacebar.  (Super is also known as the Windows button on most keyboards).  This can be remapped by using Gconf.
* NDISWrapper is included in a default installation.

Updates and bug fixes from Alpha 3 to Alpha 4

* PackageKit has been updated to 0.1.7 released 2/14/08.  PackageKit features a new UI from Alpha 3 that shows what kind of updates are available and what packages are available for update.

* OpenOffice.org has been fixed and is now available in the default installation.

* Pulse Audio should be more stable in Alpha 4 than it was in Alpha 3.

* GNOME has been updated to 2.21.91

* The new GNOME clock applet includes the ability to add weather and timezones.

* Release notes are included and viewable during installation

* GNOME-DO has been updated to the latest release (bzr 113) and includes the new background theming.  Users will need to install plugins manually.

* Transmission, a Bittorrent client, has been added to the default installation and has been updated to the latest release, 1.04.  (FL-856)

Current Issues

* The latest Nvidia and ATI drivers need to be packaged.  (FL-844)

* Unpinning and uninstalling an older kernel when you have multiple kernels may cause Syslinux to not boot.  (FL-864)

* Epiphany extensions are not available in GNOME 2.21 (FL-852 due to upstream bug)

* GTK-Engines is not theming 32 bit Firefox correctly on 64 bit systems (FL-893)

* 32 bit Firefox will be included in the 64 bit version to enable Flash for users, but is not included in this release.  Users will need to remove the included 64 bit Firefox and manually install 32 bit Firefox.

* There is an issue with ldconfig that may cause issues with wireless connectivity and / or cause GNOME Panel crashes for users upgrading from Alpha 3 to Alpha 4.  This bug has not been reproduced on new installations.  (FL-877 and FL-891)

Packages Not Included

* Glipper
* GIMP.  GIMP is not included at this time as we work on trying to get Foresight down to one installation CD.  This will be evaluated for inclusion at a later time.
* Gnumeric and Abiword: Not included in this alpha, but are being evaluated for inclusion vs. OpenOffice.org.
