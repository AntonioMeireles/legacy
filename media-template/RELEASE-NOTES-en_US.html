rPath Linux 2 Beta Release Notes

Release 2.beta1

Welcome to rPath Linux!  rPath Linux is a freely-available Linux
operating system distribution, built with the Conary distributed
software management system, supported and maintained by rPath, Inc.
The rPath Linux distribution contains high-quality, up-to-date
software, and is the base development platform for creating software
appliances and purpose-built distributions using the rBuilder Online
tool at http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/

This release is a beta release and is not production software.
We know of many issues, including issues that are known to make
various software components not work, and we are also aware of
integration failures.  As you test rPath Linux 2 beta 1, please
record issues that you encounter in the rPath issue tracking system
at https://issues.rpath.com/

Please use rPath Linux 2 beta 1 only for testing, and not to
deploy any form of production services.  Do not use it in any
case in which prolonged instances of software failure, or
destruction or loss of data, will inconvenience you.

Hardware Requirements

    x86: i686-class processor (i586 and earlier are not supported)
    x86_64: all AMD64 and EM64T processors are supported

    Hardware platform supported by the Linux kernel 2.6.23.14.

    Installation from CD/DVD installable ISO images requires
    256 MB RAM on the x86 architecture, and 512 MB RAM on the
    x86_64 architecture.  The graphical installation process will
    run faster with 512 MB.

    Installation from CD/DVD appliance ISO images requires
    much less memory; however, requirements have not yet been
    investigated.

    Installation will use approximately 2GB of disk space.  Run-time
    memory requirements depend entirely on the software being run.

Major Contents

    - Conary 2.0.4
    - Linux kernel 2.6.23.14
    - GCC 4.1.1
    - Glibc 2.5
    - Xorg-X11 7.3

Updates

    The "conary updateall" command will update all the software
    on your system managed by Conary.  The "conary update group-dist"
    command will update all the software on your system that was
    (or could have been) installed from the distribution media.

    Security advisories are published for beta releases of the
    rPath Linux operating system, but non-security-related update
    advisories are not.  Security updates for beta releases are
    lower priority than security updates for generally available
    releases.

    Note that updates to 2.beta1 are not generally expected to
    work correctly.  The structure of groups in rPath Linux 2 is
    very different from the structure of groups in rPath Linux 1
    and the set of available software is significantly different.
    rPath Linux 2 is primarily intended to be a base for software
    appliances rather than a stand-alone operating system.
