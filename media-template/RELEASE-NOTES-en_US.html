<h3>What's new</h3>

Foresight 2.1.1, released May 6th, features the latest stable GNOME desktop, a new kernel, new notification area, and Xorg improvements.

<h4>GNOME 2.26</h4>
Foresight features the latest GNOME release, GNOME 2.26.  GNOME 2.26 features improvements to file sharing, better support for multiple monitors and projectors, integration with fingerprint readers and many more updates.  For more information, visit http://www.gnome.org.

<h4>Kerenl 2.6.29</h4>
Foresight includes a new Linux kernel, 2.6.29.2, which add support for Wimax, new wireless drivers such as Ralink rt2860/70, and other updates. 

<h4>Notification Area</h4>
Foresight becomes one of the first distributions to include a revamped notification area, called notify-osd.  Notifications are not only improved visually, but ntofiy-osd improves the way you interact with system notifications.  A number of applications including Pidgin, Gwibber, Banshee and others support the new notification system.
