What's new

Foresight 2.0.2 is a minor point release featuring 

GNOME Display Manager

The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) has been updated and features an all new interface when logging in to your desktop.  Users are presented with a list of users, and clicking on the user will bring up the password dialog.  (Users can still type their user name and GDM will now auto-complete the username as well).  Language selection has been moved to the bottom center of the screen.

New Kernel

Foresight's kernel has been updated to 2.6.25, featuring better hardware compatibility.  Improved support for Intel's i915 and ATI r500 graphics, new sound card drivers, and better wireless support, including Atheros.  For a full list of kernel changes see: http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges

This new kernel also fixes issues with the Foresight Live Media.  New Live Media including LiveCDs and virtual images will be available in the near future.

NetworkManager

NetworkManager has been updated to include much better stability, specifically for users with a wired connection.

Mono Stack

The Mono stack has been re-built to be faster and improve memory consumptions.  Users using Banshee, F-Spot and other Mono applications will benefit from the improved Mono stack.

Banshee 1.0 Preview

Foresight features Banshee 0.13.2 as the default music manager.  Banshee's upcoming 1.0 release is also available for testing, and can be installed side by side with Banshee 0.13.2.  Banshee 1.0 (0.99.2) features the addition of video playback, improved Last.fm integration, burning integration with Brasero, improved Podcast support, and an all new interface.  To install, search PackageKit for "banshee-1" and install.
