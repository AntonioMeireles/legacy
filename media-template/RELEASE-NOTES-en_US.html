<h3>What's new</h3>

Foresight 2.0.5, released September 24th, features the latest GNOME desktop, GNOME 2.24, and a number of updates, including Xorg, Compiz, PulseAudio and HAL.

<h3>GNOME 2.24</h3>

<h4>Track Your Time Better</h4>

<p>For many people in business, it is crucial that they track how much time they assign to each project and client. Everybody has their own system for this, from keeping a diary to making a guess. It's incredibly tedious. In today's world almost everything you do somehow involves a computer, so GNOME has added a panel application to make tracking your time easier.</p> 

<p>The panel shows you what task you've been working on and for how long. Clicking on the button allows you to change activity and see what activities you've been working on today. If you like, the timer can stop when your computer goes idle.</p> 

<p>Activities can be categorized by any grouping you choose, be it the type of activity, client's name or how much you dislike it. You can also view and edit your activity log, insert missing activities and see daily, weekly and monthly graphs to see where you're spending most of your time. </p>  

<p>To enable the Time Tracker applet, right click on the GNOME panel at the top of the screen, and click "Add to Panel", and choose "Time Tracker".</p>

<h4>Ekiga 3.0</h4>

<p>Ekiga is a fully-featured SIP audio/video conferencing client for GNOME. As part of GNOME 2.24 we're proud to announce the release of Ekiga 3.0.</p>

<p>As well as a new interface that is centered around your phone book and the presence of your contacts, Ekiga 3.0 features SIP presence support, PBX line monitoring, better video codecs support (H.264, H.263, MPEG-4 and Theora), accelerated video and optional fullscreen and many SIP-related improvements for robust conferencing. </p>

<h4>File Management</h4>

<p>As well as icon and list views, GNOME 2.24 now offers the compact list view, popular in several other desktop environments. Choose the view by selecting ViewÂ â–¸ Compact  from the menu (or keyboard shortcut Control+3). </p>

<p>As with icon and list view, the size of the icons in the compact view can be changed using the zoom options in the View menu.</p>

<p>The browser mode of the file manager now supports tabs for rapidly switching between directories within a single browser window. </p>

<p>Today's modern filesystems are able to handle almost any desired character as part of the filename. Unfortunately this is not the case for the FAT filesystem that is commonly used on many USB thumb drives and portable music players, which is unable to use many common punctuation marks as part of the filename. GNOME 2.24 detects when you are copying files with names that contains characters that cannot be used and automatically converts these characters to a "_" without you having to rename the file yourself.</p>

<p>Automatic filename completion ("tab" completion) has also been improved in GNOME 2.24. Completion of filenames in the location bar using the Tab key is now faster and more predictable. It is also possible to complete any fragment of the path and the interface provides more feedback for when there are no other possible matches available. </p>

<h4>Do More With Deskbar</h4>

<p>The Deskbar in GNOME 2.24 adds several exciting new plugins: a calculator, Google Search (and code search), Yahoo! and Wikipedia suggestions plus updating of Twitter and identi.ca.</p>

<p>Also new is the ability to easily download and install new plugins directly from the Deskbar repository on the World Wide Web. </p>

<p>To enable the Deskbar applet, right click on the GNOME panel at the top of the screen, and click "Add to Panel", and choose "Deskbar".</p>

<h4>New Screen Resolution Controls</h4>

<p>More and more computers (especially laptops) are gaining support for multiple monitors (known as multihead). Users need to be able to connect a second monitor, either as a clone (e.g. a projector for giving presentations) or as an extension of their desktop.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.24 has upgraded its screen resolution controls to make this possible. Utilizing the new XRandR 1.2 specification from X.Org, this dialog enables users to easily set up individual monitors in a number of configurations. Monitors are named and the names appear in the top left corner of the screen for easy identification.</p>

<p>Changes are applied immediately. No restart of GNOME is required. </p>

<p>Some X.Org video drivers do not currently support XRandR 1.2 and so will not be able to take advantage of these features. One such driver is the proprietary nVidia X driver. </p>

<h4>Extra Pretty</h4>

<p>GNOME wants to help make your computer look better, which is why we work hard on our themes and artwork. For GNOME 2.24 we ran a competition to collect some of the most intriguing desktop backgrounds our contributors have produced and we've shared our favorites with everyone. </p>

<h3>Other Updates</h3>

<h4>Xorg</h4>
Foresight features the latest X Window System, including X.org 7.4 and X Server 1.5.1.  These releases feature better multi-monitor support, graphics driver support and a number of bug fixes and improvements.

<h4>Compiz</h4>

Foresight includes the latest version of Compiz, 0.7.8.  Compiz provides 3D effects for your desktop, and this new version features new plugins, including a fade pluging and "obs" (opacity, brightness and saturation) plugins, as well as a number of bug fixes and translation updates.

<h4>PulseAudio</h4>

PulseAudio has been updated to the latest release, 0.9.12.  PulseAudio features numerous improvements and bug fixes to make the sound experience better.

<h4>HAL</h4>

<p>Foresight has upgraded to the latest release of HAL, the Hardware Abstraction Layer.  Users should have better support for devices from MP3 players to notebooks suspending to keyboard support and more.</p>
