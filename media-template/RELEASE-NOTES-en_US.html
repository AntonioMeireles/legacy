rPath Linux 2 Release Notes

Release 2.0

Welcome to rPath Linux!  rPath Linux is a freely-available Linux
operating system distribution, built with the Conary distributed
software management system, supported and maintained by rPath, Inc.
The rPath Linux distribution contains high-quality, up-to-date
software, and is the base development platform for creating software
appliances and purpose-built distributions using the rBuilder Online
tool at http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/

Hardware Requirements

    x86: i686-class processor (i586 and earlier are not supported)
    x86_64: all AMD64 and EM64T processors are supported

    Hardware platform supported by the Linux kernel 2.6.24.6.

    Installation from CD/DVD installable ISO images requires
    256 MB RAM on the x86 architecture, and 512 MB RAM on the
    x86_64 architecture.  The graphical installation process will
    run faster with 512 MB.

    Installation from CD/DVD appliance ISO images requires less
    memory; 256 MB RAM should be sufficient on either architecture.
    Note that with 512 MB RAM or less, swap will be enabled during
    the installation process, which requires writing partition
    tables to disk earlier during the installation process than
    would be done otherwise.

    Installation will use approximately 2GB of disk space.  Run-time
    memory requirements depend entirely on the software being run.

Major Contents

    - Conary 2.0.14
    - Linux kernel 2.6.24.6
    - GCC 4.1.2
    - Glibc 2.5
    - Xorg-X11 7.3

Updates

    The "conary updateall" command will update all the software
    on your system managed by Conary.

    rPath Linux update advisories, both for security and maintenance
    updates, are published on mailing lists:

     o  To receive only security updates but not maintenance updates,
        subscribe to security-announce@lists.rpath.com at
        http://lists.rpath.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce

     o  To receive security and maintenance updates, along with
        summaries of changes in each group version, subscribe
        to update-announce@lists.rpath.com at
        http://lists.rpath.com/mailman/listinfo/update-announce

    There is no need to subscribe to both lists. 

    Change summaries with links to advisories are posted to
    http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Advisories:rPath_Linux_2_Changes

    Note that updates from rPath Linux 1 to 2 are not generally
    expected to work correctly.  The structure of groups in rPath
    Linux 2 is very different from the structure of groups in rPath
    Linux 1 and the set of available software is significantly
    different.  rPath Linux 2 is primarily intended to be a base for
    software appliances rather than a stand-alone operating system.
