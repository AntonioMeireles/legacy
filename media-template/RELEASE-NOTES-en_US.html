What's new

In addition to a new toolchain, Foresight 2.0 features:

PackageKit

With the 2.0 release of Foresight, the Foresight System Manager has been officially replaced with PackageKit.  PackageKit aims to be a unified package manager and installer available for many different Linux distributions, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution to ship with PackageKit using the Conary backend. PackageKit is a GUI tool for managing software packages and updates for your computer, including installing, removing or searching for new software.

After a default installation, PackageKit is installed and running on your system.  PackageKit is configured to check for updates once a day, and you will be prompted to install them by clicking on the PackageKit icon on your panel.

To manually search, add or remove software, click on System -> Administration -> Add / Remove Software.

Additional documentation on using PackageKit can be found on the Foresight Linux Wiki at https://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/

Compiz and Compiz Fusion

This Foresight release an updated Xorg and Compiz, including Compiz Fusion.  Users should see speed improvements with all three major graphics cards, including Nvidia, ATI and Intel.  Fusion Icon has been deprecated in Foresight 2.0.

To start Compiz, press and hold ALT+F2 and type "compiz".  Intel and ATI users may need to update their xorg.conf and switch from vesa to intel and radeon respectively.  Nvidia users should run "sudo conary update nvidia nvidia-kernel" to install the Nvidia drivers.

Syslinux

Syslinux has been added as the default bootloader during installation.  Syslinux is under active development, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution shipping with Syslinux.  After installation and during boot-up, Syslinux will appear as Extlinux at the bootloader screen.  GRUB is still an option during installation.


Major updates and bug fixes since Beta 1

* PackageKit has been updated to 0.1.9 released 3/5/08.  This PackageKit update includes bug fixes as well as an improved systems update interface.

* GNOME has been updated to 2.22.0

* The new GNOME clock applet includes the ability to add weather and timezones.

* GNOME-DO is included in the default installation and started in a user's session.  To bring up GNOME-DO press Super+spacebar.  (Super is also known as the Windows button on most keyboards).  This can be remapped by using Gconf.

* Proprietary codecs have been removed.  Users will be prompted to install them automatically the first time they try to use them.

* GNOME-DO has been updated to the latest release (bzr 113) and includes the new background theming.  Users will need to install plugins manually.

* Transmission, a Bittorrent client, has been added to the default installation and has been updated to the latest release, 1.06.  (FL-856)

Current Issues

* The latest ATI drivers need to be packaged.  (FL-844)

* Unpinning and uninstalling an older kernel when you have multiple kernels may cause Syslinux to not boot.  (FL-864)

Packages Not Included

* Glipper is not included by default
* GIMP.  GIMP is not included at this time as we work on trying to get Foresight down to one installation CD.  This will be evaluated for inclusion at a later time.
